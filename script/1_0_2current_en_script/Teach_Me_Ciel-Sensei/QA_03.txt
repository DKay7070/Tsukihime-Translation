Eh... what's up with this ending?%{n}
Was Tsukihime always a horror%{n}game?
<Page2>
What the heck did you do this time,%{n}Glasses?//More like 'what did you do', implying that he took some stupid choice again.
<Page3>
Are you telling me that you did something to deserve%{n}having your//this touches upon my last comment, but basically this is more like, 'did you do something so dumd that you had to be hit from behind and thrown into a horde of zombies!?'
 ass handed to you by a bunch of zombies?
<Page4>
Oh, so you did.//'Oh, wait, you did, didn't you.' going with the flow from the last line.
 You tried to go it alone%{n}against all those zombies.//'You tried going in and mowing down all the zombies by yourself' 無双する, slangy term for trying to go in and be cool on your own.
<Page5>
But if you cut a zombie, it will bite you back.
 So all in${n}all, I guess you got your just desserts, nya.//This last part 'of course that would happen nya.' is more like, 'you come out even', as in: well, if you try and cut a zombie, they'd bite you back, so evens stevens.
<Page6>
Remember folks, don't go into a building
 with a sign that${n}says "Do not enter", okay?
<Page7>
(That cat actually said something sensible...)
<Page8>
Ahem. It was very noble of you to be so eager%{n}to
 fight to protect the people of the city.
<Page9>
However, it seems that luck was not on your side.%{n}
This is not a problem that Tohno-kun can handle alone.//I changed the wording here a little, but it's basically fine.
<Page10>
How unfortunate... Perhaps if things turn out a little%{n}differently,//changed 'turned' to 'turn', so it makes more sense.
 you could try going back to the%{n}department store again with that same courage.
<Page11>
Huuh. So you're telling him to go again after witnessing%{n}that horror scene.//Technically, the word used here is "splatter" (as in, splatterhouse movies, or whatever) not "bloodshed". It's not a big deal however.
 Yup, you're definitely a sadist.
<Page12>
But why did this turn out so bad?%{n}
Maybe challenging them to a rap battle was the play here?
<Page13>
The two men who were guarding the department store%{n}
were irritated because there had been some trouble the day%{n}before.
<Page14>
The hard-working heroine had surveyed the department store%{n}that day,
 so they were on guard as a result.
<Page15>
So, if for whatever reason,//changed 'however' to 'so'
 that heroine was not%{n}able to work on that day...
<Page16>
Then the two guards at the department store
would not%{n}have had such murderous intent.
<Page17>
I don't want to say this too loud, but once you clear%{n}
one of the routes, spend some time after school in the%{n}tea room.
<Page18>
This department store vampire event%{n}
is a major turning point for a heroine%{n}change.
<Page19>
So folks, make sure you keep this info in mind!
