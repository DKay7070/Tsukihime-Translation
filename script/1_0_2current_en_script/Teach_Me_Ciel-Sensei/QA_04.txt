Oh dear, Dead End!
<Page2>
You there, Tohno-kun!
Stop right there, you are under arrest for speeding!
<Page3>
Why do you look so happy, Ciel?
There's a BBQ'd protagonist right here, you know?
<Page4>
Pardon me. The big battle had finally begun
so I got a bit carried away...
<Page5>
This Q&A corner is brought to you by your guiding
instructor Ciel, and this outsider Neco...
<Page6>
Welcome to "Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!"
<Page7>
Depending on how you played,
this may have been your first dead end.
<Page8>
In that case, how do I put this...//The first part 'in that case' isn't quite the nuance here. If we take out 'how do I put this' it makes it clearer: 'It was just that natural of a choice, or atleast this time it was'. That said, it might need some better wording. Perhaps italics on 'that'?
It was because you chose what was natural, this time at least.
<Page9>
But let's stay calm and check the situation carefully.
Humans can not survive under flames!
<Page10>
Well, from a feline point of view,
I can appreciate this kind of dead end nya.
<Page11>
Think about it, there's a beautiful woman fighting in front of you.//絶世 as in peerless/unequaled, so perhaps instead of 'beautiful woman', you could go for 'peerless beauty'
Who in their right mind could keep their cool? There's a phrase for this.
<Page12>
"A chestnut in the fire is a picnic.//This seems like nonsense since its a reference to Japanese idiom. But you'd have to rephrase so much of this conversation since they start riffing on this stuff that I'm honestly not sure what to do. I'll leave the comment here just in case any editor is brave enough to tackle it.
Welcome, welcome, welcome."
<Page13>
What do you think?
Does it irresistibly whet your appetite, mademoiselle?
<Page14>
No, I have no idea what you're saying...
Although, I personally like my meat well-done...
<Page15>
Oh really? That was unexpected.
You don't like your steak a little bloody even though you're from France?
<Page16>
I like tender meat the most when it comes to beef curry,
but rare steak is a bit... at least mentally.//this is not 'mentally', quite the opposite. 生理的 literally means 'physiologically'. Think of it more like 'instinctively' or something like that. Also, with how Japanese works with implications and what not, it might be worth adding 'too much' after 'a bit' here. In English thoughts aren't ended halfway like this.
<Page17>
The people who like rare, or something like raw sashimi,
would be someone like Akiha-san, I guess.
<Page18>
I mean, Japanese people are known for preparing sashimi//replaced 'cooking' with 'preparing' 
from raw fish, right? It's honestly unbelievable.//replaced 'out of' with 'from'
<Page19>
You fool. Fish is better the fresher it is.//replaced 'more fresh' with 'fresher'
<Page20>
If you don't take my word,
I'll buy you a round of sushi next time.//回らない寿司 as in not 回転寿司 (sushi-go-round, or whatever people call it in English), which is more of a fastfood approach to sushi. She's gonna treat her to the good stuff, is the implication.
<Page21>
You do like "karei" (righteye flounder), right otaku?//Otaku here is actually used in its original meaning, as a pronoun.
<Page22>
...Well, it's not like I eat the
same menu every day either...
<Page23>
Sometimes seafood is the way to go...
<Page24>
Right. It seems that we have completely different tastes.
Oh well. Come on, wrap it up. We'll have dinner after this.
<Page25>
R-right, of course.
We're still in the middle of the lesson.
<Page26>
Well, in other words, a fight between vampires
is extremely dangerous, so just watch the fight calmly from afar.
<Page27>
Don't worry. I'm sure Tohno-kun will have his chance to shine.
So until then, make sure that you stay alive at all cost!//more like 'So until then, make sure to keep your stamina preserved' if we are being literal. Perhaps 'make sure you preserve your strength' would be better.
<Page28>
―――Right, that's job well done!
We're going straight to Messiaen!//I'm not certain about this, but I think this is actually supposed to be 飯案 (obscure word, basically means 'meal plans') rather than a reference to some crummy old French composter.
<Page29>
...This time it's seafood curry!
<Page30>
