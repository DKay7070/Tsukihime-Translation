This is the Q&A corner where we guide Tohno-kun
who has reached a dead end that he has no clue about,
<Page2>
It's time for "Teach me! Ciel-Sensei!".
Good evening. Instructor Ciel here.
<Page3>
God Cat. (TL: I am the god of cats)
<Page4>
Now then. About the cause of death this time,
how do you explain what just happened, God?
<Page5>
Dunno, I'm just an ordinary god.//'I'm a god so I dunno' is what she actually says. That said, it sure is RANDOM and WACKY to make such a dumb statement so it might come across as making no sense. Don't worry though, that's how Neko-Arc is.
I didn't even get to pick a choice after all.//She's saying there wasn't any choice immediately before the dead end. 'Besides, there wasn't any choices right before.'
<Page6>
Right, this is quite the rare case.
This is an outcome that occured due to a much earlier choice.
<Page7>
It was morally wrong for you to lie to your family,//The one being lied to that leads to this end is Hisui (not family), and the word used here is お家の方, that is 'person from your house'. Perhaps "It is morally wrong to lie to someone from your home" is good enough?
let alone to go investigating so late at night.
<Page8>
If you know about the choice that I'm referring to,
then go back to that choice and be more sincere.
<Page9>
Lying is bad, honesty is king nya.
Yup, yup. That's exactly right.
<Page10>
Come on, take a good look at my beautiful self
that looks just like that vampire heroine...
<Page11>
After all, deep down a heroine should never lie
or have anything to hide.
<Page12>
Hey, isn't that right, Ciel-sensei?
<Page13>
Speaking of which, is there something that
you would like to share with us nya~?
<Page14>
―――Tch!
<Page15>
Nya nya nya, it's useless～☆
You'll never land a hit on my honest heart nya～☆
<Page16>
Oof oof wah st- sto- nyagh
<Page17>
Haah... well that wasn't so painful...//'Haah... well aren't you nimble' is more the implication here.
I see... I guess we were... evenly matched...
<Page18>
With all being said, this is the end!//more like 'that's all for now'
Let's meet again at the next dead end lesson!
<Page19>
Ack... if only you hadn't hidden your weight and weapons, ugh....//Here Neko-Arc is saying that Ciel in usual cases only hides her weapons and weight. I guess the implication is that she hid her mad punching skillz too?
