OS. OS. OS.
 Phew.
<Page2>
I've been pressing the O and S keys for 20 hours.
 With%{n}all this typing, I could have developed an app by now.
<Page3>
Phew... nothing like some coffee after work.%{n}
This atmosphere makes me feel like even I%{n}finished a hard day's work.
<Page4>
Now then, as for this morning's%{n}<Glasses Gazette|d e a d   e n d   >...
 Ahh, a direct hit from the enemy I see.
<Page5>
Glasses-kun, could this be...
 an attempt to%{n}reincarnate into another world?
<Page6>
(How on earth is she pressing the keys with those hands?)%{n}
I see...
<Page7>
Since what you did here was like pulling a dump truck onto%{n}yourself,
 one could argue this incident arose from%{n}your own carelessness.
<Page8>
However, it could also be due to the bad influence from%{n}that vampire.
<Page9>
I mean, if you have a unit of heavy machinery like an%{n}excavator right next to you,
 it's only human nature%{n}to want to use it for a tricky job.
<Page10>
How is that human nature?
 And don't call me a unit.%{n}It's heroine. Heroine.
<Page11>
They're basically the same.%{n}
Just look at the end result.//実際、できたワケですし。
<Page12>
Jeez. It's not like you at all to act so%{n}
freely without considering the consequences.
<Page13>
%{n}Were you feeling dizzy from all the damage you took?
<Page14>
Nyah. Wasn't I just overly happy
 from being%{n}relied on so much?
<Page15>
―――I see.
 I hope you get kicked to death%{n}by a horse.
<Page16>
It seems that half of the blame goes to Tohno-kun
 and%{n}the other half goes to Arcueid.
<Page17>
This is no time for playing%{n}around.
 The climax is right in%{n}front of you.
<Page18>
This time, try to choose the option that%{n}will
 get you as far away from Arcueid%{n}as possible!
<Page19>
Ehh~~.
 If it was you in that situation, bet you would%{n}have done the same nya~.
<Page20>
Hehe. No way, absolutely not.
 I don't have%{n}that kind of muscle strength after all.
<Page21>
%{n}――――――.
