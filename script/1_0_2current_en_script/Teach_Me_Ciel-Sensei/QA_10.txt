I wonder if you've gotten used to the sudden deaths by now?
<Page2>
This is a rescue corner for Tohno-kun
who has died despite his best efforts,
<Page3>
"Teach Me! Ciel-Sensei!".
As usual, let's begin the lesson!//Where did 張り切って go? perhaps 'As usual, get fired up and let's go!'
<Page4>
That being said, this is just a standard 3-choice path, right?
We just have to go back and pick another option, no?
<Page5>
Shouldn't the rescue corner be
about saving people before they get killed?
<Page6>
I only realized this just now but,
<Page7>
isn't this section just us seeing how glasses
instantly dies and then giving our takes on it?//changed this second part to plural, since it was 'アタしら'
<Page8>
Huh? Well you're not wrong, but what about it?
<Page9>
Besides, deaths aren't memorable if they're not painful, right?
<Page10>
Mmmm~~, you went right past Sparta and straight to Sadist.
<Page11>
Now then, the cause of death this time is due to
Tohno-kun entering the school at night alone.//if there were italics, highlighting 'at night' here might be good.
<Page12>
There was no senior to rely on, and there was
no way Arcueid would go to an isolated place at this point.
<Page13>
So go back to the previous choice
and choose a place that is more bloody!//bloody is a bit generic, perhaps 'stinks more of blood'
<Page14>
"At this point"?
Did I hear that correctly?
<Page15>
Ciel, do you know why a perfect
heroine like that decided to run away (be cute)?
<Page16>
Why wouldn't she rush home after feeling
her stamina running out?//Neco-Arc says her stamina is overflowing, not running out. This is another case of 'Neco-Arc says something stupid, and it was corrected into something that seemed less stupid. Let Neco-Arc be stupid. 'Is it not because she was so overflowing with stamina that she had to go home in a panic?'
<Page17>
Who knows.
I can't really say.
<Page18>
If I had to guess, maybe it's because she finally
realized that she was a vampire? Or something like that.//自覚 has a bit more nuance than just being aware. 'she finally realized what it meant to be a vampire' or something like that is more the intent.
<Page19>
I mean, she seemed to be losing control of herself
ever since they were at that garage full of dead apostles.//Not Dead Apostles (使徒), but the Dead (死者)
<Page20>
Really? Did you feel your chances of winning
slip away after her fever (cuteness) from back then?//This seems to be missing the point somewhat. 'Seriously? She was suffering from a fever (cuteness) even back then. Ciel really has no chance at winning huh?'
<Page21>
Are you okay? Wanna go back home (India)?
<Page22>
Who says that I'm from India!
<Page23>
More importantly, just because it's your route
doesn't mean you should get too carried away.
<Page24>
It's not just the adorable Tohno-kun,
for whom instant death fits well, that can die instantly.
<Page25>
Did you just say "fits well"?
<Page26>
As the story progresses, there is a possibility that
anyone can die. Arcueid is no exception.
<Page27>
Ehh~~?
Surely there's no way I could lose from here.
<Page28>
We're pretty much near the climactic ending, right?//less climactic, more 'emotional'. Probably best to render as 'happy ending'.
Even a newborn calico cat like me knows this.//not 'like me', the こんなん here talking about the above line. 'Even a newborn calico cat would understand as much' or something like that.
<Page29>
I see.
So what would happen if you were wrong?//She's more saying it like 'What if that were not the case', talking about the happy ending, of course
<Page30>
Nyha nyha nyha. How silly... If that did happen,
I would gladly give up my seat to the next heroine!//Neco-Arc wants to take a bet here. "Let's bet the heroine role for next route on it" or something like that. Of course, this is all foreshadowing that the next bad end is the one where Arcueid gets killed, so Ciel wins the bet.
<Page31>
Hold on a sec.
Did I hear something unpleasant just now?
<Page32>
Now that I've got your word, let's wrap up the lesson!
<Page33>
That's all for this corner,
"Goodbye! Neco Arc-Sensei" ~☆
<Page34>
Oi, stop with that scary face! Are you really a heroine?
