Good afternoon.
Were you surprised at the sudden bad end?
<Page2>
This is the rescue corner to guide the lost Tohno-kun
to the right ending,
<Page3>
Welcome to "Teach me, Ciel-sensei!".
Instructor Ciel here (presumed to be 18 years old).
<Page4>
Seriously?
How come you're an instructor when it says "teacher" in the title?
<Page5>
Well, let's not worry about these small details.
You'll come to understand the gist when you see me in action.
<Page6>
Good afternoon, Sommelier Queen of the bad end world,//This 'Sommelier' here was rendered as Somire, which is wrong so I corrected it.
banned from the main story for being too overly sexy Neco-Arc here.//this 'overly' is probably superfluous
<Page7>
You, are you perhaps new to this kind of adult corner?
Well, this is the first lesson after all, so let's settle down, shall we?
<Page8>
It's fine for you to just ignore this creature next to me.
Basically, just pay attention to what I have to say for these lessons.//instead of 'just', 'only' might be more appropriate, since it emphasises what Ciel wants you to hear here: Ignore Neko-Arc.
<Page9>
Now, about the cause of death this time...
<Page10>
You're already burning up, Glasses-kun.
Isn't being a human torch on the road a bit too hardcore?
<Page11>
How did it even turn out like this, Ciel?
Were there landmines in the streets of this town?
<Page12>
To answer that question, it was because
you went out alone even though you were spotted.
<Page13>
"There's no way I'm staying in a room with this brain-dead vampire,
 so I'm going back home!"
<Page14>
I understand how painful it is for you
but you must be patient, little one.
<Page15>
Although you were dragged into this mess,
you can't deny that you are involved now.
<Page16>
This enemy in question... until you deal with this vampire,
you absolutely must not go back home!
<Page17>
Even when you go outside,
you still have one last chance right?
<Page18>
At that time,
all you have to do is go back to the hotel.
<Page19>
But like... it would be embarrassing if the heroine's
favorability went down because you came back halfway...//This is the line that sparked some discussion on the discord. 'favorability' can be replaced by 'affection' and 'came back halfway' sounds a bit suspect. It's more like 'coming back after running away in the middle of things'.
<Page20>
Let's lower it all the way.
Better yet, please take this lesson with a grain of salt.//This is wrong. 塩対応 is to treat someone with resentment. Ciel is advising you to be mean to Arcueid, basically. 'Actually, treat her badly throughout the whole game please' is probably how I'd phrase it.
<Page21>
After all, this vampire's favorability wouldn't be lowered
no matter what Tohno-kun does!//"After all, no matter what Tohno-kun says, it won't change this vampire's affection for him!" is what we decided on in the discord for this line.
<Page22>
Ehh. Surely that is not the case nya~.//"Hmm, I don't think that's true at all~" is what I wrote on discord for this line
There are times when you get angry you know?//"I get angry too~" is what I wrote on discord.
<Page23>
But you know, I can't get enough
of that frantic feeling whenever she's yelling and stuff.//"But you knooow, I just kinda can't get enough of that frantic way in which he berates me." This is for both this line, and the one above.
<Page24>
Well, look here.//見なさい means literally "look", but she's more like going "There you go again"
Don't you have any awareness of romance and such?//Rather than just romance, 恋愛脳 is more like 'lovestruck fool'. Ciel is saying that Arc has no self-awareness of how foolishly in love she is.
<Page25>
Even though you're the same heroine, it would be nice//"I wish you could follow the example of your fellow heroine, who works hard and always keeps her composure into the end." Is a more accurate way of putting these two lines. It's quite bad as it is.
if you were cool and just as hard-working as her.
<Page26>
Huh?
(What the hell is she on about?)//"(as if going 'who are you to say' in objection)"
<Page27>
Eh?
(What kind of reaction is that?)//"(as if going 'what kind of reaction is that?' in surprise)"
<Page28>
Eh?
(Wait, you're serious aren't you?)//"(as if going 'wait, you're serious aren't you' in concern)" I'll leave the exact phrasing of these last 3 to the proofreaders, but it should give you an idea of what was missing from the initial translations
