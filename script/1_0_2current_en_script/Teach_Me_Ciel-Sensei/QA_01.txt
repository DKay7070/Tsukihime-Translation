Good afternoon.%{n}
Were you surprised at the sudden bad end?
<Page2>
This is the rescue corner to guide the lost%{n}
Tohno-kun to the right ending.
<Page3>
Welcome to "Teach me, Ciel-sensei!".%{n}
Instructor Ciel here (presumed to be 18 years old).
<Page4>
Seriously?%{n}
How come you're an instructor when it says%{n}"sensei" in the title?
<Page5>
Well, let's not worry about these minor details.%{n}
You'll get the gist when you see me in action.
<Page6>
Good afternoon, Sommelier Queen of the bad end world%{n}Neco-Arc here.%{n}//This 'Sommelier' here was rendered as Somire, which is wrong so I corrected it.
I'm banned from the main story for being way too sexy.//this 'overly' is probably superfluous
<Page7>
You, are you perhaps new to this kind of adult corner?%{n}
Well, this is the first lesson after all, so let's%{n}settle down, shall we?
<Page8>
It's fine for you to just ignore this creature next to me.%{n}
You only need to pay attention to what I have to say for%{n}these lessons.//instead of 'just', 'only' might be more appropriate, since it emphasises what Ciel wants you to hear here: Ignore Neco-Arc.
<Page9>
Now, about the cause of death this time...
<Page10>
You're already burning up, Glasses-kun.%{n}
Isn't being a human torch on the road a bit too hardcore?
<Page11>
How did it even turn out like this, Ciel?%{n}
Were there landmines in the streets of this%{n}town?
<Page12>
To answer that question, it was because%{n}
you went out alone even though you were%{n}spotted.
<Page13>
"There's no way I'm staying in a room with this brain-dead%{n}
vampire, so I'm going back home!"
<Page14>
I understand how painful it is for you%{n}
but you must be patient, little one.
<Page15>
Although you were dragged into this mess,%{n}
you can't deny that you are involved now.
<Page16>
The enemy in question...%{n}until you deal with this vampire,%{n}
you absolutely must not go back home!
<Page17>
Even when you go outside,%{n}
you still have one last chance, right?
<Page18>
At that time,%{n}
all you have to do is go back to the hotel.
<Page19>
But like... if you come back with your tail between your%{n}legs, maybe you'll lose the heroine's affection.%{n}
That's gotta be embarrassing.//This is the line that sparked some discussion on the discord. 'favorability' can be replaced by 'affection' and 'came back halfway' sounds a bit suspect. It's more like 'coming back after running away in the middle of things'.
<Page20>
Let's lose all her affection, then.%{n}
In fact, please be mean to her at every%{n}opportunity.//This is wrong. 塩対応 is to treat someone with resentment. Ciel is advising you to be mean to Arcueid, basically. 'Actually, treat her badly throughout the whole game please' is probably how I'd phrase it.
<Page21>
After all, no matter what Tohno-kun says,%{n}
it won't change this vampire's affection for him!//"After all, no matter what Tohno-kun says, it won't change this vampire's affection for him!" is what we decided on in the discord for this line.
<Page22>
Ehh, I don't think that's true nya~.%{n}//"Hmm, I don't think that's true at all~" is what I wrote on discord for this line
'Cause I get angry too~.//"I get angry too~" is what I wrote on discord.
<Page23>
But y'knoow, I kinda get a kick out%{n}
of him getting really mad at me, actually.//"But you knooow, I just kinda can't get enough of that frantic way in which he berates me." This is for both this line, and the one above.
<Page24>
See? There you go again.%{n}//見なさい means literally "look", but she's more like going "There you go again"
Are you genuinely unaware that%{n}you have love on the brain?//Rather than just romance, 恋愛脳 is more like 'lovestruck fool'. Ciel is saying that Arc has no self-awareness of how foolishly in love she is.
<Page25>
Why can't you follow the example of your fellow heroine,//"I wish you could follow the example of your fellow heroine, who works hard and always keeps her composure into the end." Is a more accurate way of putting these two lines. It's quite bad as it is.
%{n}who works hard and keeps her cool to the end?//Ciel literally says 'cool' in the spoken lines so I have kept this. -Maz
<Page26>
Huh?%{n}
(That's rich, coming from you.)//"(as if going 'who are you to say' in objection)"
<Page27>
Hm?%{n}
(What kind of reaction is that?)//"(as if going 'what kind of reaction is that?' in surprise)"
<Page28>
Eh?
(Wait, you're actually serious?)//"(as if going 'wait, you're serious aren't you' in concern)" I'll leave the exact phrasing of these last 3 to the proofreaders, but it should give you an idea of what was missing from the initial translations
