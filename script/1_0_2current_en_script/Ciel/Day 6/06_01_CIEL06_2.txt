"I understand. I will refrain from pursuing this matter any further.//The whole file is identical to 06_00_ARC06_2 (up to page 22 included there)
After all, I am also at fault for you not being able to contact me."
"But there's no way that you're at fault here right?"

"I was the one who took away your cell phone. #If you had it back then, even a careless brother like you would have at least tried to contact me, am I wrong?"
<Page6>
"――――"
Well... no, but actually...
Kohaku did secretly return it to me, but...
<Page7>
"However, #this will be the sole exception. Please refrain from such conduct in the future. You are the only male of the Tohno family after all, so it will be troublesome if you do not understand your own position a little better.
If bad publicity were to spread, it would affect the future social relations of the Tohno family."
<Page8>
"Well, surely it's not that much of an issue. They never had any interest in what I did, my relatives that is.
In fact, you're the successor of the Tohno family, so if it's about family matters, you could have sent me somewhere else or find a more suitable son-in-law."
"―――――"
<Page9>
...?
For some reason, Akiha falls silent.
<Page10>
"What's wrong? Are you not feeling well, Akiha?"
"I am fine. If you can afford to think about me, please take better care of yourself instead.
After all, you are the one with chronic anemia, Nii-san."
<Page11>
"...Mmm."
She's right. I do collapse from anemia rather frequently.
<Page12>
"In any case, please do not leave the house alone too often.
Even without me saying, the city has become very dangerous these days. People like you that act so vacantly are practically asking to be attacked by random attackers after all."
"In that case, it's okay. Those kinds of incidents will never happen again."
<Page13>
The series of murders that had the city in an uproar.
The reportedly modern-day vampire, the culprit that has yet to be discovered even now, and the darkness of the night terrorizing people.
However, all of that is now in the past.
<Page14>
"――――Huh?"
"I mean that there aren't any more vampires. The killer has already been caught."
<Page15>
"Is that so? #That is good news indeed, but... Nii-san, you sure seem to know a lot about this."
"Y-Yeah. I just happened to be at the scene of the arrest and whatnot."
<Page16>
I laugh at the ridiculousness of my own statement.
I suppose it really was all just a series of coincidences.
<Page17>
The two days I spent with Arcueid.
So much has happened that it feels like a dream even now, but at any rate, the monster that has been nesting in the city is gone.
When I put it like that, I can say that I was glad and proud of that fact.
<Page18>
"Nii-san? What is the matter, you look so happy all of a sudden."
"It's nothing special.
It's just that, I realized that it was finally all over."
<Page19>
I smile and murmur those words without realizing it.
In any case, it seems that Akiha accepts it even with an explanation like that.
I thank her and stand up.
<Page20>
"Well, now that I feel better, I'm starving. Can I go and get some breakfast?"
<Page21>
"T-There is no need for you to ask me for permission.
I am not responsible for managing your breakfast, so please take care of it yourself. If it is Kohaku that you are after, she is probably preparing breakfast in the kitchen."//朝食まで管理する気はありませんから、ご自由に摂ってください。琥珀なら厨房で朝食の支度をしているでしょうし」More like "I have no intention of (going as far as) managing your breakfast"
"Thank you. Then if you'll excuse me."
