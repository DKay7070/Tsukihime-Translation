Unfortunately, I don't have anything to talk to her about.
She keeps on smiling, not seeming to mind the fact that I'm at a loss for words.

"Um... do you go to school by train, Senpai?"
"Well, yes. I use it when I have to.
What about you, Tohno-kun? Is your house far from here?"
<Page3>
"Yeah, it's pretty far. I get on at the end of the line.//遠いですよ、始発駅からなので。
But, that's in the past now. Today's the last time I take the train to school."//でも、それもおしまいです。電車通学は今日で最後」
"Oh. Are you moving?"
"......"

"I guess we'll part ways here.
Thanks for keeping me company. If you see me at school, please don't hesitate to say hello, OK?"
<Page8>
Waving her hands with a smile, Senpai runs off.
She's so lively that I feel like running as well, but I'm not in any particular rush.//feel or felt? あまりの軽快さにこちらも走りたくなったが、とくに急ぐ理由はない。
<Page9>
I have my health to worry about, so I decide to go to school at my normal pace.//体調の事もあるし、いつも通りのペースで学校に向かう事にした。
