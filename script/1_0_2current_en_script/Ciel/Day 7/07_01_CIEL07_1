―――For some reason, waking up this morning felt good.
<Page2>
I’m fully conscious from the moment I open my eyes.
My hands, which usually don’t work for a few seconds after I wake up no matter how much effort I put into it, went to the glasses beside my pillow without pause. With them on, my vision becomes normal
<Page3>
"...Well, what a surprise. I’m feeling incredibly well this morning...?"
<Page4>
Is it because I slept my way through yesterday? Or did Professor Arach’s IV drip work?
Whatever it was, I feel really good. Too good in fact, that it’s making me a bit anxious.
<Page5>
There’s a knock on the door.
After around ten seconds, Hisui entered the room.
<Page6>
"Pardon the intrusion."
"Morning, Hisui. As always, thanks."
<Page7>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama. I see that you are already awake."
"I slept like a log yesterday, so yeah. I’ll head down to the dining hall after I get changed. I’m feeling really hungry, so could you let Kohaku-san know to make my breakfast portions a bit bigger than usual?"
<Page8>
"I understand. I’m sure nee-san will be delighted."
Hisui bowed and exited the room.
The way she carried herself felt a bit different than usual, to the point that I accidentally called out to her midway.
<Page9>
"Hisui, did something good happen?"
"Yes. Your complexion has improved significantly, Shiki-sama. As your personal caretaker, there is no greater joy in this world than seeing you well."
<Page10>
　So she said, and promptly exited the room.
"――――――"
Perhaps, to Hisui, those words were to be spoken as a natural part of her occupation. However, it felt like a sneak attack to me.
"Ah, um... Yeah, well, thanks."
As I scratched my flushing cheeks, I blabbered out something only I could hear.
<Page11>
"―――No, now’s not the time for this.
I’m feeling good in a good while, I need to change quickly."
<Page12>
I switched my gears and shifted to preparing for my morning.
It's Monday.
The start of the week. A good time to start from scratch.
<Page13>
On today’s breakfast menu was Japanese.
White rice and miso soup#.
Spinach boiled in soy sauce with a squid base.
And with triops shrimp as the main dish, it was a meal that went easy on the stomach.
<Page14>
"Here, please feel free to dig in.
If you feel like having more, I can add another course for you, so please let me know."
<Page15>
"Ah... Sure..."
A simple course it may be, but what on earth is this glowing <charm|a u r a  >radiating from this? Does Kohaku-san really not have a culinary background from some restaurant?
<Page16>
"Actually, no, this is more than enough. Thank you very much."
I clapped my hands together, offered my gratitude for this lovely meal and started eating.
My chopsticks advanced forward to make up for yesterday.
Before I could even relish my meal, my bowl lay empty before me, side dishes exhausted.
<Page17>
"...I’m sorry, I didn’t savor this.
...Um, could I please have seconds?"
<Page18>
"Of course. Please give me a moment, I’ll go refill your bowl."
With that, she took my bowl and was on her way to the kitchen.
<Page19>
And while her back was turned, I spoke up,
"Ah...Then could you-"
"? Would you like to request something extra?"
I tried to ask for what I wanted, but closed my mouth right away. I just couldn’t.
<Page20>
"No, never mind. I’ll leave it up to you, Kohaku-san."
"Yes, by all means. If it comes down to it, I’ll take just a teensy-weensy bit from Akiha-sama’s portions!"
<Page21>
"I feel like I don’t want to be around to find out what happens after that..."
Perhaps feeling elated because of my rare request for seconds, Kohaku-san disappeared into the kitchen.
<Page22>
"......but-"
I’d feel bad if I said this to her, but strangely enough, I still felt somewhat unsatisfied.
I could feel my appetite’s presence, and the food was delicious too.
But with every bite I took, my appetite dissipated.
Like, 'This doesn’t hit the spot' kinda feeling. I craved something less elegantly seasoned and something more... Raw. Like fat, greasy junk.
<Page23>
For example, something like raw meat and entrails.
I could not help but desire something that would remind me of the vividity of life itself, rather than something refined and delicately cooked.
<Page24>
With Hisui seeing me off, I leave the Tohno mansion behind me.
The time is 7:30 AM.
I did spend some extra time eating, but in the end, I was right back on track at my usual time to school.
<Page25>
Monday, the first day of the week. The front of the station is crowded with office workers and students alike, all on their way to their offices and schools respectively.
This scenery never changes.
One small thing that has changed though, in front of a certain departmental store, there was a sign that read ‘Entrance Blocked, Do Not Trespass’.
<Page26>
"...That store...#"
Senpai and co. probably cleaned it up in secret.
A departmental store that ran through a vampire nest.
Ever since the catacombs collapsed and Vlov died, this place became just another ruin.
<Page27>
"...Oh. It all really is over."
Senpai had said her purpose here was to get rid of the vampires.
That she’ll leave the city once that’s over.
So, I can’t ever meet her again.
There won’t be any more lunchtimes with me, her and Arihiko. No one to talk about random things with. No one to liven up the mood.
<Page28>
...To be honest, I have a mountain of regrets.
Just the thought of Senpai not being there even if I go to school, just makes me want to turn around and go back home.
Even so, Senpai fought to protect this mundaneness of daily life. To feel so bad about it itself is disrespectful to what she did.
<Page29>
Besides, I still remember her.
'I’ll erase your memories of me tomorrow.', she had said. And yet, she didn’t go through with it.
<Page30>
Maybe she decided to let me keep them. Or maybe they just didn’t bother because it was a pain.
Whatever it is, it doesn’t really matter. I can’t ever see her again, but at least I can reminisce about the good times. If this is the prize I get for winning that battle, I’ll gladly take it.
