 ......Senpai lives in a typical apartment.
 It is a rented room with one kitchen and a bedroom for a single person.
 The room was neat and clean, befitting an upperclassman, and such a trivial thing relaxed my paralyzed nerves a little.
<Page2>
"Here, wipe yourself off with this."
 Senpai hands me a bath towel.
<Page3>
"...... Sorry, I was hoping I could find a jacket or something, but it looks like I don't have any clothes your size.
 Please bear with me for a moment. I'll make you a hot drink right away."
<Page4>
 Senpai retreats to the kitchen.
 I'm left alone in the small, neat room.
"―――――――"
 I never thought I'd end up in a woman's room like this.
<Page5>
 An unfamiliar apartment.
 An unfamiliar room.
 A woman's bedroom, that I was dragged into while stained red.
<Page6>
"Yes, thank you for waiting......#Tohno-kun!
 What are you doing, you haven't wiped yourself at all!"
<Page7>
 Senpai sharply scolds me and starts drying the top of my head with the bath towel.
<Page8>
 "Here, take off your jacket. And your shirt too!
 Good grief! I swear if you get pneumonia, I won't even care!"
<Page9>
 I've never seen someone this upset by another person's behavior.
 Senpai begins unbuttoning my shirt in a fierce manner.
"――――――"
 Senpai instantly stops her fingers, as if she had been splashed with cold water.//I think the literal translation of 冷や水をかけられたように is understandable enough here, otherwise put "frozen in shock"
<Page10>
".......... Umm.
 ...... This is a wound that's already closed, right?"
<Page11>
 Her reserved voice reminds me.
 I have a scar on my chest that looks like a burn mark. If you saw it without knowing anything about it, it wouldn't be pleasant.
<Page12>
"Um, ...... I mean, does it hurt?"
"I'm fine. ....... It's been seven years since I got it."
<Page13>
"I see.
 ...... Thank goodness, if this wound was the reason you weren't feeling well, I'd have to take you to the hospital right away."
<Page14>
 Senpai smiles softly and faintly.
 Seeing that smile, my heart aches.
<Page15>
"...... It's fine. I can do it myself, just leave me alone."
"Okay. I'll get you some tea then.
 Oh, after you take off your shirt and wipe yourself off, please wrap yourself in the blanket over there instead of a jacket."
<Page16>
".................."
 I do as I was told, taking off my shirt and wiping my upper body.
 I don't feel comfortable taking off my pants, so I wipe the water off my legs.
 Instead of using the blanket, I wrap my upper body in the bath towel.
<Page17>
"Oh, are you finished? Shall we have some tea then?"
 Senpai sits down with a tea set in her hand.
<Page18>
"Tohno-kun, please have a seat.
Won't it be hard to relax if you stay standing?"
"..............."
I do as I'm told and sit down.
Senpai fills a mug with tea and hands it to me.
<Page19>
"――――――――"
We don't say a word to each other.
 Senpai is drinking her tea, acting as if nothing is wrong.
<Page20>
 Feeling out of place, I sip my tea.
 ............ I'm surprised. It's very hot.
 It's so hot that the tip of my tongue tingles, and I feel the pulse pounding through my body.
 It's a type of heat that makes my heart, brain, and other functions that had stopped start working again.
<Page21>
 Senpai doesn't ask me anything.
 After a few moments, my mug is empty.
 Senpai pours tea into my empty mug, as naturally as if it were a habit.
<Page22>
"............ Umm."
 Something. I feel like I have to say something, anything.
<Page23>
"Tohno-kun."
"H―――――!"
 I reflexively jerk my body back.
<Page24>
"I'm going out for a while. Can you watch my apartment?"
"Oh ......... um, yeah, okay, but..."
<Page25>
"Yes, then, please. I'll be back soon, so don't do anything too weird."
 I don't know how serious she is, but with a smile, Senpai leaves.
<Page26>
 ―――――.
 I'm alone again.
 The mysterious heat that I have felt up until now quicky dissipates.//It's a change from the original where 何かが makes the sentence vague about what exactly is warm, as in Shiki doesn't understand it, so I've compensated with mysterious.
<Page27>
 Senpai didn't ask any questions.
 She let someone like me into her room, took care of me, acted as if that was a normal thing to do.
<Page28>
 ...... I didn't notice.
 More than the warmth of the tea or the neatness of the room, it was the fact that someone was there for me that soothed my paralyzed mind.
<Page29>
"... How selfish of me."
 My heart aches.
 Until a moment ago, I was alone. Being by myself, feeling nothing, giving up thoughts, those were my only relief.
<Page30>
 But now, the mere fact that Senpai is gone makes me anxious.
 It makes me want to scream like a child, begging for forgiveness.
<Page31>
"――――, ―――― ......"
 I desperately try to hold back the tears and sobs that threaten to leak out.
 It's terrible. It's too much for a human being.
<Page32>
 ... Even though I wished I was dead.
 ... Even though I don't deserve to be treated kindly by Senpai.
 ... Even though I'm a murderer.
 Now I'm selfishly thinking that I want Senpai to come back as soon as possible―――――
