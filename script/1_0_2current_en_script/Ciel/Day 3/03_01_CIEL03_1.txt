When I enter the classroom, I find that homeroom is about to start.
I wasn't used to the route, so I must have paced myself wrong.
The morning chatting period is coming to an end, and most of the students have gone back to their desks.
<Page2>
In that situation,
"...Hah, you've certainly arrived with a lot of time to spare, huh?"
Arihiko is standing there with a dejected look on his face, about to take his seat. ...He actually seems to be taking class seriously today.
<Page3>
"Good morning. Not too energetic this morning I see...# No that can't be it. You came to the classroom after all. What? Are you feeling unwell?"
<Page4>
"I was full of energy until a while ago. After all, Senpai came to visit me."
"By Senpai, do you mean Ciel-senpai?"
<Page5>
"That's right. Buuut, given a certain someone wasn't here, she didn't quite seem to be in the mood anymore and went back to her classroom. Why's it that this, of all mornings, is when you decide to show up at the very last minute?"
<Page6>
So that's what happened... if I knew that Senpai was waiting, I'd have come here running.
<Page7>
"Sorry about that. But there's always the possibility we can meet up with her at lunch. It's not like this was our last chance to see her."
"Of course not. If this was our last chance,
I'd be too shocked to be sitting in class."
<Page8>
'Is that so?', I reply, waving my hand as I head for my desk.
As soon as I sit down, the bell rings and Noel-sensei enters the classroom.
<Page9>
"Hiii, Guud Mornin'!
I'm glad to see everyone's in good shape... wait,# oh no, there are two absentees. It is the change of season after all.
I wonder if they got careless and caught a cold."
<Page10>
Noel-sensei starts taking attendance.
One male student and one female student are absent.
I try to remember who those two empty seats belong to,
when, by chance, my eyes meet hers.
<Page11>
"―――Ah"
I look away in panic.
...I wonder. I'm sure it's just my imagination, but I think Noel-sensei is looking at me most of the time...
