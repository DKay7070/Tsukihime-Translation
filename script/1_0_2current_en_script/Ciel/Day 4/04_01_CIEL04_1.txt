"....nghh"
I was awakened by a faint light.
The sound of rain had stopped. The sky was cloudy and gray, but the light was still enough to wake me up.
<Page2>
"Good morning, Tohno-kun. Did you get a good sleep last night?"
"Yes, good morning Sen...pa....."
<Page3>
I... remember.
Last night, I stayed in Senpai's room, borrowing her bed #and I felt more comfortable after a night of sleep. I suddenly became embarrassed and jumped out of bed.
<Page4>
"Good morning, senpai!
Thanks a lot for yesterday. You did a lot for me――――"
"Yes, you owe me one."
<Page5>
Unlike me, who was in a panic, Senpai had her usual smile.
She really in another league.//Lit. she's increasingly above me, out of my reach, more and more outclassing me
She is a much more mature person than me.
<Page6>
"...... Then I guess I owe you one. If there is ever a time when I can pay you back, then I will."
<Page7>
..... I don't know what will happen in future.
Still, if I'm fortunate enough to have the opportunity to return the favor, I want to help her in any way I can, no matter how small.
<Page8>
"...... I'm going home now. The rain has stopped."
"Oh, is that so?
It's only six in the morning, Tohno-kun."
<Page9>
"Yes, but I stayed out yesterday without permission. If I don't get back to the mansion as soon as possible, I don't know what Akiha will say."
<Page10>
"Akiha...... Oh, you mean your sister.
I called her yesterday, #so I think you will be fine."
Senpai said something outrageous.
<Page11>
"You called......at my home?"
<Page12>
"Yes. I thought your family would be worried if I didn't tell them that you would be staying at my house. #I hope I didn't cause you any trouble."
"No...that's....."
<Page13>
My throat quivered in fear.
The fact that Ciel-senpai called my home means that a female student of the same age told Akiha that "Tohno Shiki will stay at my house."
<Page14>
"This is bad, very bad. In a different way than yesterday, I might as well be dead."
<Page15>
"......Tohno-kun......, was sleeping in my room so awful for you?"
<Page16>
"Oh, no, I don't mean that. My family is an anachronistic one... anyway we have strict rules.
It's not that I didn't want to be with you."
<Page17>
"You don't have to make any excuses.
I knew I was meddling....... Also, bento boxes from convenience store for dinner were not very feminine....."
<Page18>
Senpai sadly closed her eyes.
Since last night, she has become a very special person to me, someone I have a lot of respect for as a human being.
When someone like that is sad, I feel hurt as well.
<Page19>
"No, seriously, you're not meddling!
You see.....I'm really grateful. If it wasn't for you taking care of me, I would have made another mistake, and convenience store lunches are alright and I was nervous in bed, but I slept right through it!
Even now, I'm happy to see your face, and it makes me feel so much better!"
<Page20>
I just rattled off all the thanks I could think of.
――――――――――
<Page21>
"I see. You have returned to your usual form. I don't know what happened last night, but I'm glad you're feeling better like this."
<Page22>
Where did the sad face from earlier go, Senpai is chuckling.
<Page23>
"...... Ciel-senpai?"
"I'm just kidding. I wouldn't call Tohno-kun's home directly either. I asked Inui-kun to call and say that Tohno-kun stayed at his house last night."
<Page24>
"Good ......, then there's no problem, but you're joking too hard, Senpai. That one seriously made me think my heart would stop."
<Page25>
"Yes. I'm a bit of a tease.
You know, when you like a person you want to tease them, don't you? It's the same."
<Page26>
―――――――――
Person you like.....
<Page27>
"But it's true that you should go home sooner than later.
Um, wait a minute."
Senpai held out a folded shirt to me.
<Page28>
"Here you go. I washed it in the morning, though the jacket is still not dry."
"Oh, I see.... I really am thankful, for everything you've done."
<Page29>
"No, it's just another bonus. I was lucky to have the wimpy Tono-kun rely on me."
<Page30>
Even if it's just a way to make me feel better, I'm honestly happy right now.
I got my clothes from Senpai, changed in the changing room, and hurried to the entrance of the apartment.
<Page31>
"I'll go then.
......Senpai. Thank you very much for yesterday. As you said, I don't know how I can help you, but I will seriously think about...... making amends in my own way."
<Page32>
"Yes. I'll see you at school then."
<Page33>
Senpai sends me off with a smile.
...... I might never see that smile again.
The body of the woman I killed yesterday must have been found by now, and the police may have arrived at the mansion.
<Page34>
But that doesn't mean I can run away anymore.
Now, grateful from the bottom of my heart for her smile, I begin to make my way back to the Tohno mansion.
