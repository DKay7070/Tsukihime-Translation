...Arcueid is right.
For a vampire... no, from a tactical viewpoint, focusing on restoring our fighting strength without considering potential victims makes sense.
<Page2>
"...Right, I guess. You are a vampire after all."
<Page3>
But, I can't.
Despite that, I can't agree with Arcueid's plan.
When I decided to fight, it wasn't only for my own survival. 
<Page4>
"I know what you're going to do.
But can we really not take them by surprise? You said that sleeping Dead Apostles are cautious, but how dangerous are they?" 
<Page5>
I think about Arcueid as she was yesterday.
She was completely defenseless while she's asleep. 
Other animals are defenseless while sleeping, but for Dead Apostles, it's less about defenselessness and more about carelessness... To use a metaphor, I'd say it's like a machine cut off from electricity. 
<Page6>
...If so, we have a chance to win.
I can't even get close to Vlov normally, but if he's asleep, I've got a surefire way to kill him... //起きている to normally
<Page7>
“How dangerous is that? It's almost like attacking a castle.
Dead Apostles will build a strong fortress and sleep deep inside of it. 
Everything from the main gate to the deepest part is guarded by retainers, so it would probably be night by the time we break through."
<Page8>
"'By the time we break through'... would it be difficult for you to attack Vlov's castle, even at full-strength?" 
<Page9>
"Don't take me so lightly. If I wasn't weakened, I would have crushed his castle head-on. 
...Well, he would simply run away in that case. 
Experienced Dead Apostles prepare their escape route in advance, and if an individual stronger than themselves approaches, they will run away at once.“
<Page10>
"...If an individual stronger than themselves approaches..." 
In other words, if it's one insignificant human, there is a good chance that he will keep on sleeping without raising the alert. 
<Page11>
It's an advantage that Arcueid doesn't have, but I do. 
It takes a lot of firepower to destroy a castle. 
But a bit of poison is enough to kill a single living being.  
<Page12>
"I get it. You're right, it's going to be difficult for you and me to attack. 
...But is Vlov's stronghold really that dangerous? Ah, I'm talking about the size, the number of minions, that kind of stuff." 
<Page13>
"Mmh, around lower-middle in terms of difficulty. It's more of a maze than a castle, and he's just using a department store.
Yeah, I'm sure that's the entrance. I'm sure of it." 
<Page14>
"A department store?" 
That's not a technical word used by vampires that I can't understand right? She's talking about a normal department store where people go shopping, right? 
<Page15>
"Yes. The big one in front of the park at the north gate. 
It's well hidden, but it's the nest of that Dead Apostle. I think the food is being sent to the Castle Lord from that department store." 
<Page16>
"I-It really is that department store! N-No, more importantly, that means there's a vampire den in the middle of the city!?”
<Page17>
"W-What? I wasn't one that set it up! 
Ants and bees nest in your house, don't they? 
It's the same thing. Considering that Dead Apostles are parasites that live on human blood, the closer their home is to a human city, the more efficient they are."
<Page18>
"――――――" 
I turn away from Arcueid, who says such a thing as it was obvious. 
...I'm even more determined. 
I'm not going to let a pest like him remain so close even one more second. 
<Page19>
...Right.
What Arcueid can't do, 
I'll do. I can do it even if I'm alone.
