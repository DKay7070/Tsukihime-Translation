I walk into the hallway toward the stairs.
Whether I want to go to the cafeteria or the store, I have to get down to the first floor.
<Page2>
...However.
On my way down to the first floor, I encounter something strange.
The new teacher, Noel-sensei, is standing in the hallway doing nothing.
<Page3>
It is unusual for a teacher to be in the hallway during lunchtime.
At our school, teachers usually have lunch in the staff room, the preparation room, or the teacher's area in the cafeteria.
There is no reason for them to spend time on the second-floor stair landing.
Could it be...
<Page4>
"Sensei. Are you lost by any chance?"
I'm sure that's not the case, but just to be sure, I called out to her.
<Page5>
"No way, do I look that unreliable?
It's just a change of pace, a little breather.
Because the staff room is so homey..."
<Page6>
"'We'll only be with you for a short time, but please consider us family.'
It's a little bit of a shock, isn't it?
I wasn't prepared to attend a welcome party on the first day of the job.
Isn't it scary when everyone is smiling?"
"―――Hah. Well, that's true."
<Page7>
I'm the one who's taken aback.
Noel-sensei's frank remarks made me agree with her as if we were friends.
<Page8>
"Right? I thought that high school teachers would be exhausted from dealing with all the kids who act like adults.
A teacher must be tough, positive, and smiling.
I'm confident in my smile too, but I'm not as good as the other teachers."
<Page9>
As she says this, Noel-sensei puts the mobile phone she was holding in her hand into her suit pocket.
...It didn't look like she was on the phone or composing an email. Is she taking a picture or something?
<Page10>
"But well, I can't keep slipping out forever, can I?
I'm giving up and going back to the staff room.
But still... fufu. What do you mean by 'are you lost?'. Even though we're in school, that's so weird! Or is that just a Japanese pick-up line?"
<Page11>
"N-No, not at all."
"I know, I know. I'm just messing with you ☆.
See you later, Shiki-kun. Thank you for being so considerate ♥."
<Page12>
Noel-sensei hums as she walks down the stairs.
She's a teacher with soft manners.
But...
<Page13>
"How did she know my name...?"
As the new homeroom teacher, she seems to have already memorized the names and faces of all the students in her class.
I might have misunderstood her attitude, she might be a dedicated teacher after all...
