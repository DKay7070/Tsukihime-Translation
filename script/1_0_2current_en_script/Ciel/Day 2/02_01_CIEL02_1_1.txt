I'll take it easy in the cafeteria.
Fortunately, I'm feeling good today.
I'll order the sumptuous 'meal set A' for a change.
It's a bit expensive so I don't usually order it, but I don't have to worry about my financial situation.

After all, as of yesterday, I am the eldest son of the Tohno family.
"I want to have the most expensive meal in the cafeteria every day."
I am sure that if I suggest this to the head of the family, she would accept it with a smile.

"I see. Then, I will give you a month's worth of meal coupons.
I will also contact the school cafeteria and find out what the menu is for the month. I will let you decide what you want to eat. Is that acceptable?"

"...Hmn?"
For some reason, I feel a chill, but I decide not to worry about it and head for the cafeteria.
I'll just enjoy the freedom to eat whatever I want.
