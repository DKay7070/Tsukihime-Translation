"I'm home."
I enter the lobby, trying my best to raise out a carefree voice.
<Page2>
...?
What's this? I hear a voice of chatter coming from the living room.
It's just before dinner. It feels a bit unnatural hearing a voice from there around this time.
Kohaku-san should be in the kitchen, and I don't think Hisui and Akiha are the type to hold a conversation.
<Page3>
"...Akiha. I wonder if she's drinking tea with Kohaku-san."
Or perhaps there is another guest.
In any case, I should head to the living room and see what's going on...
<Page4>
Right as I was about to do that, Hisui comes out from the living room.
She came to greet me after hearing my voice... Her face looks somewhat gloomier than usual.
<Page5>
"I know I'm late, but good evening, Hisui."
"......"
Hisui stares at me with a blank expression.
She did not say 'Welcome back' as she usually does.
<Page6>
"Umm... did something happen?
I might be imagining it, but you look a little upset..."
<Page7>
"―――There is a visitor waiting for you.
She has been waiting in the living room for quite some time, so please make yourself there at once."
"A visitor for me?"
Hisui nods affirmatively.
<Page8>
"...That's odd. I don't know anyone that would want to visit me. The only one that should know about my move is Arihiko, and it's not like I made any acquaintences recently―――"
―――No, hang on.
I have an incredibly bad feeling about this.
<Page9>
"Hisui. This visitor... what's she like?"
"She is a pretty lady with golden hair."
<Page10>
"Wha-"
Hisui's description was straight to the point.
Reflexively and automatically, I run toward the demonic living room as fast as my legs would allow it.
<Page11>
"What the hell is going on here―――?!"
I open the door with all my strength and enter the room.
<Page12>
But it was already too late.
I come face-to-face with the earth-shattering event of my life path that is impossible to recover from.//I HATE THIS SENTENCE IT MAKES ME ANGERY
<Page13>
"Oh my. Welcome back, Nii-san.
It appears that you arrived late tonight as always."
<Page14>
"Ah, you're finally here, you lil' rascal. Not only do you make your little sister wait, but me as well. You really are quite the tyrant."
<Page15>
The two of them look at me with completely different expressions.
...This feeling. I know this feeling.
It's the same bitter feeling as a soldier being told to beg for his life as a gun is pointed at the back of his head. A scene commonly seen in films.
<Page16>
"......"
That's why there was nothing I could say to get myself out of this.
<Page17>
Of all the things that could happen, Arcueid and Akiha are opposite of each other.
As Arcueid remains calm, Akiha too, remains calm sitting on the sofa.
But whereas Arcueid remains calm as part of her second nature, it's clear from Akiha's demeanor that she looks upon her with hostility.
<Page18>
Akiha sends a glance toward me.
<Page19>
"What's the matter, Nii-san? There's no need to be standing there. Why don't you come over here and take a seat?"
<Page20>
No. I feel like I'll get slashed with a knife the moment I get close to the sofa, so there's no way I can do that.
<Page21>
"I-I'm good, thanks.
Besides that, this person here is, well――――"
<Page22>
...How do I explain this to her?
I can't just pass her off as a classmate, and calling her someone I met in the city would feel like adding fuel to the fire.
<Page23>
"Well? Go on."
Akiha pierces me with her unforgiving gaze.
<Page24>
Fine. There's probably nothing that I can say at this point, but if I don't want to hurt anyone... and especially if want to keep my life peaceful... then I must come up with an excuse no matter what.
<Page25>
I say that, but―――For starters, that vampire with a dumb-looking grin on her face like she's not involved in any of this. What sort of pretext did she use to get inside in the first place?
I can't imagine that Akiha would just invite a random stranger to the living room like that.
<Page26>
"...Before that, can I ask something?
This person, what did she say she came for?"
"Hmm?"
Arcueid tilts her head in perplexion.
<Page27>
"...Is she not a friend of yours?
That's how she introduced herself."
"Ahh, yeah, that's right, a friend."
<Page28>
"I see. I would have loved it if you had introduced her to me.
If she is your friend, then it would have been rude of me to refuse her and ask her to go home."
"Well, about that, Akiha-san."
<Page29>
My words come out in a mumble.
"Heehh. A friend, you say. Hmph."
Whether it's because she's had enough of being ignored, Arcueid forces herself into the conversation between siblings.
<Page30>
"So that's what you call me after doing such terrible things. Even when my body is still in pain."
"Wha――――――"
<Page31>
*geh*//WHAT SOUND DOES DIZZINESS MAKE?
Ah, so this is what they call dizziness.
This intoxicating feeling of being withdrawn from reality with great force... I can't bear it.
<Page32>
"...What is the meaning of this? Are you implying that my brother, with his current physique and mental capacity, harmed you in any way?
I don't mean to be rude, but are you aware of how much credibility you lack behind those statements of yours?"
<Page33>
"Yeah, totally. But don't worry, it doesn't bother me anymore. He did help me recover after all.
And so by all means, don't sweat it. I only came here to invite Shiki. We'll be going off before you know it. Isn't that right, Shiki."
<Page34>
―――Not good.
If this woman speaks any further, my body will be reduced to ruins.
<Page35>
"Well, ahahahahaha!"
Laughing in frantic desperation, I run toward Arcueid, #and grab her by her arm forcefully.
<Page36>
"Geez, Shiki, what are you doing all of a sudden?"
I can't afford to listen to her complaints.
I pull Arcueid by her arm and rush out of the room, leaving Akiha in a dumbfounded state.
<Page37>
Hisui is waiting in the lobby.
I wonder what goes on inside of that head of hers as she watches me drag Arcueid along in a dash. Thinking about it makes my stomach churn, so I should refrain from doing it for now.
<Page38>
"Are you heading out, Shiki-sama?"
"I know I'm asking for a lot and I'm incredibly sorry, but please open the front gate for me."
"Yes, of course. Please take good care of yourself."
<Page39>
Running past Hisui who was bowing out of courtesy, I run outside as if I was escaping from the mansion.
