I wake up absentmindedly.
The arm reaching out to the glasses feels slightly heavy.
I put on my glasses, wondering if it's a slight fever like it was someone else's business.
<Page2>
Even as my vision returns to normal, I still feel a slight dizziness.
It resembles the symptoms of a cold, but this is more like a morning fever.
It's like stuck engine heated on a flame which gets alleviated simply through the passage of time.
<Page3>
There is a knock on the door.
After a short pause,
<Page4>
"Pardon the intrusion."
With a single bow, Hisui enters the room.
<Page5>
"Good morning, Hisui. Thanks for coming as always."
"Good morning, Shiki-sama. I see that you are already awake."
<Page6>
"Yeah. I slept very well last night. I'll go to the kitchen as soon as I get dressed.
...Tell Kohaku-san that I have a slight fever, so she should give me a lower portion today."
<Page7>
"As you wish.
...Um, do you require a thermometer?"
"No I don't. It's just the usual slight fever anyway."
<Page8>
"In that case, your change of clothes is over here. I will wait for you in the dining room."
Hisui bows and leaves the room.
Perhaps it's just me, but her bow doesn't seem as sharp as usual.
<Page9>
"...I wonder if she's worried about me. However, this kind of thing really does happen all the time."
<Page10>
I appreciate the concern, but it's nothing to be fussed about.
If there is anything to be concerned about,
it would be a serious wound like that, no matter how you look at it.
<Page11>
"...But using duct tape really doesn't sit right with me. It makes my blood run cold just by looking at it. The next time I see her, I'll―――"
<Page12>
I stop just before I was able to finish my sentence.
There is no 'next time'.
We'll never see each other again.
There's no way I would get involved with such a dangerous woman.
<Page13>
"...That's right. I decided that would be for the best."
I swallow the undeniable fact.
Today is Monday.
The beginning of the week. A good chance to start fresh.
<Page14>
I wash my face and fix my clothes before entering the living room.
Akiha is sitting on the sofa.
It is just past 7 AM, but it seems that she already finished breakfast and is now gracefully enjoying a cup of tea.
<Page15>
"Oh, good morning, Nii-san. You are up early this morning."
Whether it was because she was pleased to see me up so early, Akiha seems to be in a good mood.
"Good morning. Likewise, you seem to be up early as alwa―――"
<Page16>
...And then. #I suddenly feel lightheaded and push down on the corner of my eyes.
And even then, the dizziness won't go away.
Without knowing what's going on, my body temperature rises and―――
<Page17>
"Nii-san...?"
I hear the faint rustle of clothes and the sound of approaching footsteps.
<Page18>
"Is something wrong? Your face is red, do you have a fever?"
"Ah... no, it's true that I have a fever, but..."
<Page19>
Akiha approaches me without reservation and peers at my face from below.
...That's odd.
For some reason, when I look at Akiha, it feels like my dizziness is getting stronger.
<Page20>
"...It seems that you have a bit of a fever.
Did you make sure to use your blanket last night? I am sure it is just your condition being deteriorated because of the change in environment, but just to be sure.
Please wait here, Nii-san. I'm calling Kohaku right now, so we will measure your temperature before having breakfast."
<Page21>
Akiha turns her gaze to the lobby. She must be going to call Kohaku-san, who is preparing breakfast in the kitchen.
I take this opportunity to look away from Akiha.
...As I thought, my dizziness is alleviated with that action alone.
<Page22>
"It's okay, Akiha. You don't need to call Kohaku-san.
I wasn't feeling well because I just woke up, so you don't have to get so worried―――"
<Page23>
"If you are not feeling well, then that is all the more reason not to leave you alone. What are you going to do if you get a cold? Even a slight illness would be a big deal to you. After all, your immunity and resistance are lower compared to the others."
<Page24>
In the midst of her astonishment, Akiha puts her hand on my forehead.
The cool, chilling sensation of her delicate palm makes my neck tingle.
<Page25>
"――――――"
My breathing stops completely in an instant.
Just as Akiha said, there is something wrong with me this morning.
I'm not sure why, but I start to get curious about Akiha's every movement.
Even seeing her gestures alone makes my body temperature rise.
Not to mention that if I were to touch her directly, I would likely collapse from the dizziness.
<Page26>
"...Nii-san? Um, aren't you feeling rather hot...?"
I feel Akiha's voice echoing, not in my ear, but directly to my brain.
It was as if her beautiful black hair and her white ceramic skin turned into heat, flowing into my head to the brim.
<Page27>
"..."
This is bad.
This is just momentary.
It's just my body being unstable from all the fatigue that I accumulated.
<Page28>
That's why right now, before I make a colossal mistake in front of Akiha, I must...
"Right, I just remembered something urgent!"
I brush off Akiha's hand and run as fast as I can.
<Page29>
"Shiki-sama? Breakfast will be ready in about five minutes..."
"Really? Thanks. Um, where's my bag?"
"If it's your bag, then it's over here."
<Page30>
As always, Hisui is well prepared.
I thank Hisui and take my bag from her.
"I'm going now. You don't have to see me off!"
<Page31>
"Stop right there! Where do you think you are going with a fever like that? #For starters, you must follow the rule of this house to never run in the corridor as I mentioned previously! Please settle down and check your temperature in the living room at once!"
<Page32>
Akiha waits for me in the lobby, perhaps in order to stop me.
But based on what she said, it seems that she's only here because of the part about running in the corridor.
<Page33>
"My bad, I'll make sure to follow the rules next time...!
My fever's gone down, so I'll just go to school like this! I'll do something about breakfast on my own, so cut me some slack today!"
<Page34>
"What do you mean you will do something about―――Wait, Nii-san?!
Hold on, what was that statement just now?! You cannot possibly call it a rule if you just follow it the next time!"
<Page35>
I run through the front door to the outside as if to get away from Akiha's nitpicking.
I put my hands together and say sorry to Akiha in my heart.
<Page36>
I appreciate that she's worried about my health, but there's no way that I could say something like,
"Well, the truth is, I feel like I'm going to collapse from the dizziness just from looking at you."
And if I did, I couldn't imagine what kind of blowback would have awaited me.
<Page37>
"Phew."
I calm down finally after taking a deep breath.
It should be safe over here.
Akiha wouldn't be so childish as to chase after her brother, especially when has to attend school herself.
<Page38>
"But it really is typical of Akiha to be upset about the rules of all things."
Remembering what she said earlier, I couldn't help but give off a bitter laugh.
Even though she's my sister, I still don't know whether her emotional boiling point is high or low even to this day.
<Page39>
"...I guess I should head to the convenience store."
I don't have a lot of money in my wallet, but I should at least get something light to eat.
<Page40>
I resent the fact that I have an appetite on a day like this.
Normally I wouldn't mind skipping breakfast, but in any case, I feel hungry this morning so it can't be helped.
So I'll just buy a single stuffed bread and hold out until lunchtime.
