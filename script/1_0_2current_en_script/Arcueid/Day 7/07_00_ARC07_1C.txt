The moment it became lunchtime, #the failure of a human being appeared at the same time as he yawned as if to say 'I'm awake now!'.
<Page2>
"*yawn* That was a good nap.
Tohno, let's go get a bite to eat."
<Page3>
That's how it is. Nothing else exists inside that skull of his other than sleep, food and sex. Or so I hypothesize.//「三大欲求」として日本で最もポピュラーなのが、「睡眠欲」「食欲」「性欲」。
<Page4>
"Sure, I can go and eat, but are you really okay with that? Eating with me that is. I thought you were obsessed with having lunch with Senpai."
"Huh? Lunch with Senpai?"
<Page5>
Arihiko frowns as if he had bitten down on a bitter bug.
It seems that he was turned down by Senpai today as well.
<Page6>
I spend lunchtime with Arihiko.
Arihiko, who had plenty of sleep in the infirmary, says,
"Looking around the front of Souya Station... Hmm, there doesn't seem to be anything new."
With his mobile phone on one hand, Arihiko scours for information diligently.
It's like they say, 'Trailing behind the world by even four hours can prove to be fatal'.
<Page7>
It could also just be a case of internet addiction, but this guy is different from the other students.//He's just built different.
For Arihiko, the news surrounding Souya Station was not just some amusing affair. In all seriousness, Arihiko vigilantly checks for the survival tool used on the night at the business district, or 'last night's weapon' so to speak.
<Page8>
"Hmm, seems to be yet another standard convenience store robbery.
An employee suffered a serious wound after being slashed with a blade by an alcoholic. Yikes, that's gotta hurt. You can't get through to a drunkard. I guess they'll restrict purchases to mail-order only."
<Page9>
Arihiko eats his meal as he continues to browse his phone on one hand.
The culture in which my father would read a newspaper during his meal transformed into the modern-day equivalent in front of me.
No, leaving that modern-day critique aside.
<Page10>
"Arihiko, is reading out those news during lunch really that fun?"
"It's not fun at all. But for the sake of my foolish friend who shares no interest in the outside world, I have no choice but to inform him of the dangers of society.
Are you hearing any of this, Tohno-kun? The north exit got destroyed, a drunkard slashed someone, and an indiscriminate serial killer is on the loose. These aren't some unrelated matters y'know."
<Page11>
"You're right. But the serial killing incident is already over.
Sure there's the incident at the north gate, but apart from that, things are the same as usual."
<Page12>
"Really? They caught the serial killer?"
"Well, they didn't exactly catch him, but―――"
<Page13>
That criminal is no longer in this world.
That's why there aren't any news with vulgar headlines regarding modern-day vampires or anything about the vampire being killed by 'someone' without any meaning.
<Page14>
"In any case, those kinds of silly incidents won't happen again, and there won't be any more victims. The town is back to normal now."
"...Hmm. But I think there will still be more victims, Tohno."
<Page15>
"No there won't. Besides, how can you even make such a claim?"
"I mean, look. The news just reported that nine bodies had been discovered this morning."
<Page16>
Arihiko shows me the screen of his mobile phone.
<Page17>
"#Eh?"
I can't believe my eyes.
In the site that gathers recent news, there was, without a doubt, new information of the vampire murders starting with a bird's-eye view photo of Souya station's north gate.
<Page18>
"You've got to be kidding. Isn't this the back of the theater that we always go to?"
"Hold on. Let me take another look."
<Page19>
I borrow the mobile phone from Arihiko.
It wasn't an ordinary person spreading misinformation nor was it a hypothesis formed by speculation.
The screen clearly shows an official statement from the police, stating that nine victims were found last night as a result of a serial killing incident.
<Page20>
"No way―――"
I could not put it into words.
That guy. Vlov. He's dead. I killed him with these hands.
And yet, why are there dead bodies with their blood squeezed dry still appearing even now...?!
<Page21>
"Still, a modern-day vampire huh. #Although I wouldn't mind being sucked on if that vampire was a gorgeous woman."
"A gorgeous... woman?"
<Page22>
My spine freezes at the loose talk of Arihiko.
'I wouldn't mind being sucked on if that vampire was a gorgeous woman.'
For me, I couldn't take those nonsensical words as a mere joke.
<Page23>
"This incident... isn't over―――"
The appearance of new victims proved that the vampire is still out there in good health.
...A simple process of elimination is all that's needed.
Vlov is gone.
That means the only other remaining vampire is―――
