The day of classes comes to an end.#
No, to be precise, it came to an end before I even realized it.
My mind was concerned with the negative thoughts that filled my head, and the next thing I knew, there wasn't a single soul in the classroom.
<Page2>
"...The serial killer... is still out there."
There is no need to think about the meaning behind those words under normal circumstances.
But I recall her saying something.
'I have never killed a human being'.
I can't bring myself to call what she said a lie.
<Page3>
"...Perhaps the news report got it wrong. Or maybe―――"
The only one who knows the answer to that is Arcueid herself.
If I can track her down and see her again, I'm sure that everything will become clear.
<Page4>
...And that's why I'm so unsure about myself.
I have nothing to do with those incidents anymore.
<Page5>
My life returned back to normal the moment I settled the score with Vlov.
I fulfilled my duty. I should have.
That's why there's no reason. No reason to go out of my way to step into such an abnormal world.
That's why it's better for me to stay like this, pretend like nothing happened and go home without a thought on my mind.
<Page6>
I'll simply go home.
That is certainly the second most correct choice.
But a long time ago, I was taught about what was the most righteous choice.
<Page7>
"―――Life is full of pitfalls for every human being. You're capable of handling them, so you should be more cheerful―――"
<Page8>
"...That's right.
There's no way I can just sit back and watch."
<Page9>
Those words saved me.
I lived my life through those words.
That's why I cannot stand by and turn a blind eye.
<Page10>
...This case is far from over.
It seems that once I get involved, it is my destiny to be caught up in such troublesome matters until the very end―――
<Page11>
I leave the school grounds.
I don't have much of a lead, but I still have the key to the apartment that she entrusted me with.
For now, I should head to the apartment.
<Page12>
"She's... not here."
The apartment was the same as before, but Arcueid was nowhere to be found.
At the very least, I can feel traces of her in this room. I feel a sense of relief knowing that everything hadn't gone up in smoke.
<Page13>
"Listen up. Finding her is not going to be that easy.
In any case, I have to act now."
<Page14>
There's no guarantee that she will return even if I wait here.
...I have no choice but to go out to the city and search for her at random, just like the time that I first met her.
<Page15>
As the sun sets, the city changes into its true night colors#.
Although I looked around the most prominent areas, I wasn't able to catch even a glimpse of Arcueid.
<Page16>
"...Even though you stroll around so buoyantly whenever you feel like it, why can't I find you at a time like this?"
<Page17>
...What should I do?
The night had just barely begun. I should―――
C:>Return to the mansion for a bit and reassess the situation.
C:>No, I'll keep searching the city.
