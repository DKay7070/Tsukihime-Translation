Today's classes are over and it's after school time#.
Or, I should say, before I knew it, it was after school.
Bad thoughts were running through my head, and before I knew it, there was no one in the classroom.
<Page2>
"...Street murders are still going on.
 I don't need to think about what that means.
 But she said,
 that she has never killed a human being, and.
 I just can't believe that those words are a lie.
<Page3>
"Are... the news mistaken, or―――"
The only person who knows the answer is Arcueid herself.
If I can find and meet her again, everything will clear up.
<Page4>
...I don't know who I am anymore.
I have nothing to do with that incident anymore.
<Page5>
I returned to my normal life when I settled the fight with Vlov.
I've fulfilled my responsibility. I've done my part.
So there's no reason, there's no reason for me to venture into such an abnormal world again.
I should pretend that I didn't notice anything and go home without thinking about it.
<Page6>
I'm going home.
That's probably the second most correct choice.
But I learned the first choice a long time ago.
<Page7>
"―――Life is full of pitfalls for any human being. You're capable of handling them, so you should be more cheerful―――"
<Page8>
"...That's right.
I just shouldn't choose to do nothing."
<Page9>
Those words saved my life.
That's what I've always tried to achieve.
Then I can't just turn a blind eye to it.
<Page10>
...The case is not over yet.
Since I had been involved in it, I am destined to be unable to escape from this trouble until the end of my life.
<Page11>
I leave the school.
I don't have many clues, but I do have the key to the apartment that she left behind for me and I never returned it.
Let's just go to the apartment.
<Page12>
"She's not here...?"
The apartment is still here, but there is no sign of Arcueid.
At least there are traces of her here. I was relieved to see that nothing had vanished in a puff of smoke.
<Page13>
"Never mind, I can't expect to catch you that easily.
Anyways, I just have to act now."
<Page14>
There is no guarantee that she will return even if I wait here.
...The only thing I can do is to go out into the city and look for her randomly, like I did when I first met her.
<Page15>
The sun was going down, and the city was changing its face to night#.
I looked around for the most important places, but I couldn't catch even a glimpse of Arcueid.
<Page16>
"...How come I couldn't find her when she's just wandering around at times like this?"
<Page17>
...What should I do.
The night has only just begun, and I should――
C:>Go back to the mansion and sort it out.
C:>Let's not give up, search the city.
