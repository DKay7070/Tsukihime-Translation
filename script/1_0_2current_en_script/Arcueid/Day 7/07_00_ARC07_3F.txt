<Page1>
We've returned to the park.
Whether she had recovered during the walk, it seems that Arcueid has returned to her former self.
<Page2>
"You're already back to normal... Don't tell me that it was all just because you got careless and took a hit earlier?"
"Eh...? No, I wasn't lying when I said that I was still recovering."
<Page3>
"...Are you sure about that?
But you did also lie to me before, didn't you?"
"Hmph. What are you talking about? I feel sick from listening to you."
<Page4>
"It's because you've been acting way too suspicious.
If you have a problem, then start by explaining what happened back there.
I think I get the big picture, but what was it that made you hurt that much?"
<Page5>
"......
Well then! Without further ado, allow me to explain what I was up to as requested!"
<Page6>
"......"
It's obvious that she's trying to change the subject...
But in any case, this works out better for me in the end.
I'll ask about her condition afterwards.
<Page7>
"In that case, help me understand something.
That guy from earlier was a corpse that was controlled by a vampire, wasn't he?
And the one controlling him is your real enemy, correct?"
"Oh my. You're rather quick on the uptake today, Shiki."
<Page8>
"Much appreciated. I have seen some things after all. I think I have a pretty good idea of what happened."
<Page9>
"Yeah. Marvelous. Splendid.
It seems the only cute misunderstanding of yours was about Vlov."
"Don't call it cute... It wasn't my fault. That time, I had my hands completely full with dealing with my own problems."
<Page10>
"Hmm. So you're hand were full, huh.
Well, let's just leave it at that."
<Page11>
Seemingly amused, Arcueid stares into my face as she makes a twirling motion... I feel sincerely uneased.
<Page12>
"That's enough, now talk... That man from earlier, he was already long dead wasn't he?"
<Page13>
"That's right. He was a servant that belonged to him, so I finished him.
He was just a low rank dead, but even so, leaving him alone would have meant that he would kill other humans and fetch their energy.
Shiki, do you remember the talk we had about vampires in the hotel?"
<Page14>
I reply with a nod, indicating that of course I remember.
...The ecology of vampires.
...Castle Lords and their relationship with servants.
<Page15>
...After vampires hunt, kill and create servants known as corpses, they entrust the collection of blood to them while they hide their own bodies.
I remember Arcueid throwing around phrases such as 'Castle Lord' and 'traditional types' when describing these vampires.
A so-called stereotypical vampire that is immortal but is weak to sunlight.
<Page16>
"You already taught me that.
...And so, you know for a fact that the vampire you've been going after is the same one that's behind all these murders?"
<Page17>
"Yeah, I'm sure of it.
Even if we assume that he worked alone from the very beginning, the murders that were commited by the dead that arose from that would lead to him in the end.
That's why―――"
<Page18>
"That's why you were wandering the city and searching for these servants.
...Would you be able to locate its master by doing that?"
<Page19>
"Only if the bonds between them are strong enough. But everything so far has been a complete miss.
That coffin... The only reason I can't find out where he's hiding is because of how much dead he's using."
<Page20>
"That guy only had to dirty his hands a couple of times. After that, all he had to do was control the people who turned undead and expand his territory while he sleeps.
The number of victims in this city is over a hundred.
The victims that you people make a fuss about are only a small fraction of those that are actually missing."
<Page21>
"――――"
...Once again, my blood freezes from hearing that fact.
Two days ago, I thought that Vlov was the main culprit.
That's why I focused all my attention on killing him. That was my way of preserving my sanity.
<Page22>
But now it's different.
This case is still not over.
There are over a hundred victims. Those who were once fellow humans were attacked, drained of their blood and eventually killed.
<Page23>
And those victims that had their blood sucked turned into new monsters. A moving corpse roaming the streets like the cluster of lines I had seen earlier―――
<Page24>
Three days ago.
I recall the crowds of people staying at the hotel being scorched away.
Even though I was at that hotel, I did not witness that scene unfold in its entirety.
That's why I could only imagine it in words without being able to grasp the extent of the horrifying violence that took place.
<Page25>
It's the same even now.
Even after hearing that a vampire is sucking people's blood, and that he's slowly expanding his territory, it still doesn't feel real to me.
<Page26>
―――However.
What would I think if someone close to me had been killed like that without any warning or meaning?
<Page27>
...I imagine it for only a short while, realizing the immorality behind such a thought.
I picture an image of Akiha as her blood is being sucked and her body being thrown away like garbage.
<Page28>
"―――――――――"
The dizziness that seems to be eating away at my brain overcomes my feeling of exhaustion.
My heart, which should have been rightfully furious, is strangely calm.
<Page29>
I tell myself that now is the time to think, and not to quiver.
I recognize that those kinds of events could happen as soon as tomorrow.
I can criticize my cowardly and powerless self for not realizing the danger some other time.
<Page30>
"So you really are upset, Shiki.
The reason I didn't want to talk about this... was because of that predator side of yours―――This case is too difficult for humans to handle after all.
For you, the actions of vampires would have been considered unacceptable."
<Page31>
Of course it is. I don't know anything about the difference between good and evil, or right and wrong.
But at the very least, all I can tell is that this is unacceptable.
<Page32>
Even if I don't know what they look like, those people have their own histories in which they lived. They all have their own hopes and dreams that they hold dear.
Even if it's something that I can't understand or has nothing to do with me, it is not something that I can easily ignore.
<Page33>
...Even I wouldn't want to be killed in such a comical manner.
Such a death would be far too pitiful. Such a death would be far too regretful.
Such a death―――would be far too meaningless.
<Page34>
"But you don't have to worry, Shiki.
It doesn't seem like there are any natural enemies of vampires in this country, but rest assured, I'm here now.
I said this before, didn't I? That my objective was to exterminate the vampire that's invading this city."
<Page35>
The mild atmosphere that had been here until a while ago was turned upside-down into a cheerful one by Arcueid.
To be honest, her words were reassuring.
I'm aware of how amazing she is and how far she would go in order to protect a life.
It was Arcueid who protected me against the cold waves of Vlov without concern for her own safety.
<Page36>
...But that's why there is something I can't understand.
There was a question that needed to be asked from even before the fight against Vlov.
<Page37>
"...I don't get it.
You're also a vampire yourself. So why do you go out of your way to help humans?"
<Page38>
"I'm not particularly going out of my way to help them.
I'm just doing it because there is nothing else to do."
"Huh?"
Theres... nothing else to do...?
<Page39>
"Although I am getting targeted because of that. I guess you could call it a neccessary expense."
"...No. I don't get what you're trying to say at all, but I do know that part is wrong."
<Page40>
"Now, now, don't worry about the minor details.
Even for someone as widely hated as I am, you still helped me take down Vlov, right? I managed to come out safe because of that."
<Page41>
"Now it's my turn to find the enemy hiding in this city and find a way to bring this to an end.
So it's okay for you to not get involved and go back to the normal life you've had until now."
<Page42>
"Ah―――yeah. That's great, but―――"
But―――are you really okay with doing this alone?
With those words popping up in my mind, I shake my head.
<Page43>
...What's wrong with me?
Why do I feel so guilty in making her take on such a dangerous task alone?
<Page44>
"......"
"Shiki? What's wrong, why are you making such a serious face again?
Isn't this what you've always wanted to hear? I don't think there's anything left to discuss."
<Page45>
...You're wrong. There are still a ton of things I want to ask you, but more importantly―――
<Page46>
"...You idiot. Of course I'd make such a face. This is a problem of the city that we live in after all."
<Page47>
"Like I said, you don't have to worry about it.
From now on, I'll watch over the city everyday, and I'll make sure that there won't be any more victims.
Or are you saying that you don't have faith in my abilities?"
<Page48>
Yeah, it's true that I don't want to get involved.
But those words...
Those words about protecting the city should not be said by her, but by someone living in this city like me―――
<Page49>
"...Arcueid. Um... is the enemy that you talk about 'strong'?
Stronger than someone like Vlov?"
"No way. Despite his appearance, Vlov is still a member of the Ancestors.
Compared to him, the vampire lurking this city is far lesser in quality."
"I see. Then he shouldn't be of any threat to you, right?"
<Page50>
"I can't say for sure. It wouldn't be a problem if it was me from much earlier, but right now I'm rehabilitating. There's a high chance that my enemy has become more powerful than me."
......
<Page51>
Wait, hold on. I just nodded at some familiar words without realizing it.
Arcueid is... rehabilitating...?
<Page52>
"Hold on. Did you catch a cold or something?!
Or rather, can vampires even catch colds?!"
<Page53>
"That's right. I caught it from some crazy and savage serial killer.
I believe the virus was named something awful like 'Tohno Shiki', are you aware of it perhaps?"
"Ah―――well, that is, um... sorry."
I just stirred up a hornet's nest.
<Page54>
"I'm kidding. I've already healed those wounds. It's just that even though I recovered, I still get tired from using more energy than I had anticipated.
The thing that hurts are the wounds I got from Vlov. I'm still covering those after all."
<Page55>
Arcueid gently caresses her own abdomen.
―――That wound.
That is another unnecessary wound she took from protecting me.
<Page56>
"―――――"
I have no words.
Everything that caused Arcueid to torment stems from me in the end.
And yet...
Why does she continue to face me with such a wide-open smile without any sign of resentment―――
<Page57>
"...That's enough. At the very least, you should rest somewhere until your wounds get better. At this point, it wouldn't make a difference if you took a day or two off, right?"
<Page58>
"I can't do that. After the fight with Vlov, it's likely that the enemy has also noticed my presence. If I took a break, it would be like letting him know that I'm weak."
<Page59>
"...But even so, do you really plan to continue doing things like tonight?"
"Yeah. Until I find out where he's hiding, I have no choice but to crush every single one of his blood-collecting dead to pieces.
Once I cut off his supply of blood, he will have to appear in person in order to suck blood."
<Page60>
"But then what if that was to happen tomorrow?!
Even if you were to hide your weakness, you would just end up getting killed in the end...! In that case―――"
<Page61>
I turn my face to the ground, pleading her not to push herself.
It's just as Arcueid said――If she were to reveal how weak she is, then the enemy would likely take the opportunity and go in for the kill.
<Page62>
And above all, I remember what happened during those two days.
Arcueid is completely serious when it comes to battle.
Her strategy was not based on how to avoid damage, but on how to take his opponent down with certainty.
Arcueid prioritizes achieving her goal more than anything else. She will not go against her word during that time.
<Page63>
"――――"
Arcueid will not stop.
Letting her go would also mean that I won't be able to talk with her like this.
She does not fear her own death to the point of going mad.
<Page64>
...And yet, why does she smile like so?
If only she hadn't made that face―――If only she had behaved more like vampire, then perhaps I wouldn't have felt like this.
<Page65>
"What's wrong, Shiki?
Your body is shaking. Do you need to go to the toilet?"
"Arcueid, you... why do you―――"
Why do you feel so indifferent towards all of this?
<Page66>
...I raise my downcast face.
<Page67>
"Hm?"
There is a woman in white standing before my eyes.
<Page68>
...I can't pretend that it doesn't exist.
I don't understand what this feeling is.
All I know is that the two days I spent with Arcueid is something I'll never forget.
<Page69>
That's why―――the idea of parting ways and watching her die the next day only to regret it over and over again like a complete fool―――is simply too cruel.
<Page70>
"...Give me a break. I've already got two broken eyes, and now even my head is about to break..."
<Page71>
I'm already tired of dealing with vampires.
I recall the fight against Vlov. The fear of being on the brink of death to the point of having chills run down my spine still remains.
<Page72>
It's the same here. This opponent is crazy. There's absolutely no reason for me to get involved.
Arcueid said that she can take care of it, so that's what I should let her do.
<Page73>
And yet...
...even though I understand the logic behind that...
...I still cannot allow her to go alone―――
<Page74>
"Ah geez, there must be something seriously wrong with me!"
I kick the ground surface.
I'm pissed of at myself for being unable to listen to any reason or advice.
<Page75>
"H-huh? What's wrong Shiki? Why are you angry all of a sudden?"
"Of course I'm angry! Because even after all I've been through, I still can't stop myself from uttering such nonsense!"
I start to feel more dizzy after saying that.
If I saw my idiotic self in the mirror right now, I would smash it without a second thought!
<Page76>
"C-Calm down. You're not acting normal."
"That's right, I'm not! I wouldn't be able to say these things if I was normal...!"
<Page77>
Cursing out, I scratch my head out of annoyance.
I didn't want to admit this, but I've already made up my mind.
After all, I've already admitted it from my own mouth just now.
<Page78>
"Geez, I don't understand you at all!
Explain yourself! You've been going on about this and that for a while, but what are you trying to say?!"
<Page79>
"I'm saying... #that I'm going to help you out until your body gets better!"
"―――Huh? Eh?"
<Page80>
Arcueid looks at me with a dumbfounded look on her face.
This is, finally, or perhaps, at last, or rather...
In any case, I got everything out of my chest, and now I've finally settled down.
<Page81>
"Shiki. Do you really mean that?"
"......"
'Hmph', I groan.
Even now, I can't believe what I just did.
<Page82>
"I think I might have misheard you.
I'm sorry, but could you repeat that one more time?"
"......"
'Hmmph', I groan even louder.
<Page83>
But it's too late for regrets now.
The moment I uttered those words, I lost every right I had to lie to myself.
<Page84>
"Come on. I want to hear that line just now one more time."
<Page85>
Arcueid makes a request to me like a whisper.
I avert my gaze from her flower-like smile and try my best to speak in an irritated voice.
<Page86>
"...Like I said. I'm the one responsible for making you weak in the first place, and I can't just let this monster run rampant in the city.
I can't rely on someone as weak as you to do it alone, so that's why I offered to help, if it's okay with you."
<Page87>
"Shiki――――!"
Arcueid's eyes shines up in a spark.
She grabs my hands and shakes it up and down with a happy demenaor.
<Page88>
"...Well, I don't think I will be of much help, but it should be better than nothing."
"Yeah! If it's you, then I have nothing to be afraid of!"
<Page89>
*shake shake shake* Arcueid still won't let go of my hands.
I'm afraid that sooner or later she would rip off my hand from shaking it with her brute strength, but even so, I have no desire to stop her.
...How do I put this,
She really did have a delightful smile.
<Page90>
Just because of that, I was able to take with small pride that this ridiculous decision was not a mistake.
