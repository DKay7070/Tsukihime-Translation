<Page1>
"So what did you want to talk about, Shiki?"
<Page2>
"Vampires. You said this before, right? That the serial killings that's been causing havoc was the work of a vampire."
Arcueid nods affirmatively.
<Page3>
"And so, are you aware of the new victims that's been reported on the news this morning?
They say that they were killed last night and were drained of their blood."
"―――――"
<Page4>
Arcueid narrows her eyes.
It was like stepping on what seemed like the ground only to realize that it was a layer of thin ice where one wrong move could lead to your death.
<Page5>
"Hmm... and?"
"Well―――you're..."
<Page6>
I swallow down on my own spit.
Arcueid pins me down with her clear-cut gaze.
It was the kind of gaze where she would immediately swoop down on me if I moved even a single inch.
<Page7>
"...But isn't it strange, Arcueid?
Vlov is dead. And yet why is there still a vampire causing a scene? I didn't want to believe this, but could it be that you―――"
If that blood was on your hands, then I―――
<Page8>
"Sigh. You don't really believe that, do you?
That wasn't me, it was the work of a different vampire."
Appalled, Arcueid answers immediately, dispelling the surrounding tension with ease.
<Page9>
"――――――"
I suppress the unknown joy inside my throat.
It's too soon to be relieved.
It's good to know that it was another vampire's doing, but there is still something that doesn't add up.
<Page10>
"If that's the case, then does it mean that these vampires will keep coming one after the other? Did a new vampire take over after Vlov?"
<Page11>
"Not at all. That incident was the work of a single vampire from the very beginning.
There's no such thing as a new vampire taking over to devour a city, and in Vlov's case, he had absolutely nothing to do with those killings."
...You mean Vlov... is unrelated?
<Page12>
"What do you mean that he had nothing to do with it?"
"I mean exactly what I said... Geez, you really can't help but to keep pushing one's buttons."
<Page13>
"Listen. It's true that Vlov is a vampire, but has he ever sucked anyone's blood?"
"Well of course he did. That guy burned all those people to the ground and then―――"
<Page14>
...So that's what she meant.
Why didn't I realize such an obvious fact?
After having their blood drained, none of the serial killing victims showed any signs of damage after their corpses were discovered.
<Page15>
But that's not what Vlov would do.
That guy burns those corpses to a crisp. It's true that he sucks blood, but that is not his main way of killing.
<Page16>
In reality, those people at the hotel were not victims of a mass murdering spree, but victims of a conflagration.
If that's the case, then Vlov has no connection at all to the serial murders in this city...!
<Page17>
"Hold on. Then who is behind these vampire killings?
Who on earth would go out of their way to do that?"
<Page18>
"Like I said, that incident is different from the one with Vlov.
I came to this city in order to kill the vampire behind those murders."
<Page19>
"The reason behind Vlov coming here is... well, it's a little ambiguous I suppose.
I thought he came here just to go after me, but with a reason like that alone... it seems that he didn't receive the full support of the Dead Apostle Association."//死徒社会 - Special term?
<Page20>
"Well, that's enough of that. Vlov is already dead after all.
At any rate, Vlov and the vampire lurking this city are two different beings. He is nothing more than an unrelated third-party."
<Page21>
"I never said that Vlov was my target, did I?
Vlov had me as his target, but as for me, my target is the vampire in this city that is known as the 'serial killer'.
...Shiki. I hate to ask this, but were you misunderstanding something that simple?"
<Page22>
"―――――"
I gasp in shock.
But it's just as Arcueid said.
<Page23>
Because she said that killing vampires was her objective, I quickly jumped to the wrong conclusion thinking that she came here to take down Vlov.
<Page24>
"...So what? Are you telling me that killing Vlov on that night was completely meaningless...?"
<Page25>
"It's not meaningless at all. You were the one who fought in my place, right? #Well, it wouldn't have been necessary if you hadn't killed me in the first place."
<Page26>
"――――――"
I feel a wave of exhaustion like I was going to fall on my knees.
...That fight during that night had no meaning.
...Even after killing Vlov, nothing was resolved in the end.
<Page27>
...That vampire is still in this city―――For a brief moment, I placed that blame onto Arcueid.
...This isn't good.
The feeling of disheartenment and my own self-loathing makes my head spin.
<Page28>
"...Sorry. I know it's annoying, but let me confirm one last time.
So you're saying that Vlov is unrelated to the vampire murders, and that the one causing havoc in this city for the past month is a different vampire, right?"
<Page29>
"Yup, that's exactly right.
But that is a matter for me to deal with, so you don't have to worry about it. #Leaving that aside..."
<Page30>
Arcueid looks up to me with a rather playful expression.
<Page31>
"...What do you want?
Just so you know, I don't have all day to play around."
I can't put my feelings in order.
I feel like my legs will give away as soon as she says anything unusual.
<Page32>
"I just have a small question. It's about that time we took down Vlov. Back then, why 3 minutes?"
"3 minutes... what do you mean?"
<Page33>
"Shiki, you said that you only had 3 minutes back then. I could never figure out why it was only 3."
"...Listen. I said that it was like the bottom of the ocean, right? That's why I said that 3 minutes was the limit."
<Page34>
"Hm? You only have 3 minutes at the bottom of the ocean?"
"――――――"
...Thank God.
If I had been more lively, I would have answered her in no time.
<Page35>
"Yeah, that's right. Unlike you, I happen to be human, so that's as much time as I can spend underwater."
<Page36>
"What the hell! E-Even I felt a bit chilly back then!
Besides, I would die of boredom from spending hours at the bottom of the ocean as well!"
A 'bit chilly', you say.//BINGCHILLING
For me, it was closer to death.
"Hm? What are you looking down for?"
<Page37>
"...Nothing, I was just feeling a little dizzy. You don't have to worry about it... No, I take that back.
To be honest, even spending 3 minutes underwater is a bit off. After all, we humans are weak, so don't group us with someone as powerful as you. If you're going to compare endurances, then do it with a fellow vampire."
<Page38>
Reaching my wit's end, I brush my hand away from Arcueid telling her to shoo.
<Page39>
"...Well, you wouldn't do it even if I told you to.
I'm aware of how much of a monster you people are after all.
Fine, I admit that misunderstanding was stupid on my part.
But besides that, Arcueid―――"
<Page40>
I manage to calm myself down somehow and raise my head to resume the conversation, but...
What is this face that she's making...?
<Page41>
"Arcueid...?"
"You're such a bully, Shiki!
I guess I'm just a good-for-nothing monster to you!"
<Page42>
Pouting, Arcueid turns away and begins to walk at a brisk pace.
<Page43>
"Hey, wait a minute. Where do you think you're going?"
"It has nothing to do with a human like you! So don't follow me!"
Arcueid must have been really mad, as she continued to walk away without looking back.
<Page44>
"......"
That woman... where the hell does she think she's going?
...Perhaps I stepped on a land mine.
Now that I look back, maybe I was being a bit too cruel...
<Page45>
"...No, but I didn't say anything that bad..."
...I didn't... right?
But seeing how upset she was, I feel like I'm the one at fault... Completely and utterly my fault like I was some sort of lowlife.
<Page46>
"...Oh fine! I was wrong! I shouldn't have said that!
So just stop. Stop where you are!"
<Page47>
Flustered, I run after her white back.
It is absolutely not because I felt guilt over making her upset.
And besides, there's still something important that we need to discuss...!
