The basic knowledge of vampires is enough to hear at the hotel.
This time let's ask a more in-depth question.
<Page2>
"Not the dead one we talked about earlier, but a more dangerous one......
You said Twenty-Seven Ancestors, right? You said earlier that Vlov was one of them, but what are they really are?"
<Page3>
"Ah, did you hear that?
After all, you did hear that!"
<Page4>
"Ahh I get it, I get it, after all, it would be after defeating Vlov.# Shiki will come to bite you~!"
"Y-Yeah?"
<Page5>
Was it the long-awaited question?
While Arcueid was being pulled from the waist while eating with good vigor.
<Page6>
"as I said before, the Twenty-Seven Ancestors are the pinnacle of the Dead Apostles. You can compare them to a king.
But we need a little more prior knowledge when talking about the Ancestors."
<Page7>
"Ta-da!
Yes, The advance edition of the vampire course is going to start."
<Page8>
A whiteboard appeared with a squeaky sound.
I'm already used to this, so I'm not really surprised, so I'll just clap my hands.
<Page9>
"Applause? Is that an applause?
Hmmmm... for a Shiki with a boring face, at least that reaction is good!"
<Page10>
No, I'm just really not sure on how to react, so I just had a serious face for the time being.
I just want Arcueid to be more serious about this.
<Page11>
"Those who become vampires from humans are classified as the 'dead', but they have stages according to their abilities and limits.
Those who have appeared here are in this rank."
<Page12>
"I won't explain it in detail,
from the III, 'Undead'
then the Rank IV and V are the 'nightkins' that lives at night
and finally, Rank VI, where it becomes a vampire that is capable to create a community."
<Page13>
"Those who have made it to Rank VI are the ones who can completely become an 'independent blood sucking species'.
And by sucking blood and making children, he can become the top of the group that he has created.
However, you can't make a child above Rank VI, for a normal vampire, that 'rise' stops there.
<Page14>
"........."
Vampires transfer their own blood to humans and transform them, and make them their slaves.
And the collection of those slaves that have been multiplied in that way is what a 'community of vampires' is.
<Page15>
If you can't make more 'children; than you, then surely, your Rank will stop there.
However...
<Page16>
"There is something that created this.... no, there is a vampire who ranks higher than that of the dead."
That's right. It's the Rank IX, Ancestor.
It was said to be Twenty-Seven Ancestors, because there were twenty-seven of them in existence.
<Page17>
"It was usually back and forth, but on the Rank VII it'll be a 'Greater Dead Apostles'
the thing on Rank VI is that it was recognized by the Ancestors and was given further abilities. even with the same name, the scale is different from that of the Rank VI."
<Page18>
"Being on this rank is like a poison that pollutes the area.
It's a heresy that average executors cannot compete with.
A vampire who has allowed his will as an aristocrat."
".....? Own will, in other words?"
<Page19>
"They're not a slave.
The Greater Dead Apostles are not absolutely obedient to their parent Ancestors, in fact, they can even go against them."
<Page20>
"If given the opportunity, the Greater Dead Apostles can even defeat their parents and inherit their cruse.
Well, it's almost impossible to beat the Ancestors. Even if the same 'freedom' is obtained, the years that the ancestors lived are enormous. It'll be difficult for a Greater Dead Apostle to exceed the size of their Ancestors.
<Page21>
"That's why if you want to inherit your Ancestor's curse, the Rank VIII, Successor.
They are said to be a talented vampire that was recognized by their Ancestor.
In other words, they're prince or princess.
Some of the Ancestors suddenly pull up to this rank for the first time when they see something that is not a vampire."
<Page22>
"Princess?...# in other words, someone like you?"
If I recalled correctly. She said she was royalty as well, this Arcueid.
<Page23>
"Hmmm, Maybe inside of me. I was made from a dead who has the same characteristic as me."
<Page24>
"If you consider that there are at least two rank VIII's per Ancestor, there are easily over 50 of them. I suppose within them there were also Ancestors who would try something like that.
Well, I and they are fundamentally different, so it's just a counterfeit product no matter where I go."
<Page25>
But I won't deny that Rank VII Vampires are definitely strong.
That's right. Basically speaking, They are surely better than Vlov.
"――――――"
Someone who surpasses that <vampire|V l o v  >.....?
There are at least 50 or so of such monsters.....?
<Page26>
"See. I knew it.
A murderer who can't behave because he wanted to kill somebody?"
"Quit fussing about. You say you're scared of this. Vampire-san?"
<Page27>
Reply on a human scale.
Now that I have decided to cooperate, I will insist on this one thing. I can't do what humans can't.
<Page28>
"Now, it's finally the main subject. the 'Rank IX'.
These Twenty-Seven Ancestors are the pinnacle of the dead, got it?"
<Page29>
"That's right. An old Dead Apostle who escaped from the position of emergency food and won independence as a completely different thing.
A crimson stain that fell from the moon to the ground.
Deadly poisons with a world that is never incompatible with others.
The ones who brought forth the birth of rank VI vampires. and devours human as 'lifespan'."
<Page30>
"It was them, the one who created this vampire society structure that has existed until now.
Although the scale of existence varies from individual to individual.
'Elders' are those who are active ever since before the Christian era.
And 'Upstarts' are the ones who started becoming active after the Christian era.
<Page31>
"For example, Vlov. He climbed to Rank IX from Rank VI in the last century. Killing his parent Ancestor and becoming the new Ancestor."
<Page32>
On a Vampire scale, Vlov is just a Dead Apostle who recently just became an Ancestor.
That's why he appeared in this city where he could not understand the tradition and beauty, and caused such problems, says Arcueid.
<Page33>
That's fine, The rules of the vampire have nothing to do with me.
What's worrying me is that strange ability.
A curse that repaints the world into frigid just by being present.
And flames that are scattered just to withstand the cold.
This is no longer what 'human-shaped things' are allowed to have.
<Page34>
"I can't understand....
No matter how long you live, the dead are just an extension of humans. Humans can't do such things no matter how many years they live.
Then maybe there's something else about it?"
<Page35>
"Yes. In fact, it doesn't matter how many years you lived to become an Ancestor.
The quality of their blood is what makes them Ancestors."
<Page36>
"The commandments of Oomoto that have been engraved in the soul.
The truth in which they have each been crowned with, the worldview that makes up the foundation of their thirst.
A singularity that rewrites the physical laws of the planet just by circulating its blood.
Principle Blood Command―――Idea Blood."
<Page37>
"Principle Blood Commandment Idea Blood."
That is.
His bottomless 'hole' that is in his innermost part?
<Page38>
"Well, it's a 'crown' if you say it.
The dead who inherits this blood will become an Ancestor no matter what rank they're in.
However, there is a millennial-class foundation that moves the principle blood commandment. Even if a dead person who has been active for hundreds of years inherits it, it will just simply be crushed by the curse."
"Just like Vlov?"
<Page39>
"That's right, When I think about it, he seems to have endured it properly.
I wonder why his ego remained even though he was a Rank VI Apostle."
<Page40>
"Well, I knew that they were quite problematic.
I don't understand what's wrong with it. He came to our city and we got rid of him.
I don't want to think about it too much, but does this make the other ancestors angry?"
<Page41>
"Ah, that's fine. The Twenty-Seven Ancestors are enemies with one another after all.
There is no Ancestor who cares even if Vlov disappears in such an island country as this."
<Page42>
"So there is no retaliation from them, right?"
"Yes. Only a few of them are in a cooperative relationship.
The five elders.... the league of the age of god, who I have even reached out to.
However, not all of them are enemies of mankind, and some of them have already been defeated."
<Page43>
"'Twenty-Seven Ancestors' is a name that indicates the way it should be, so it doesn't change, Actually... I wonder if the remaining twenty-one are still there.
Vlov inherited the principle of Offenbaum.
The principle of 'fruit', the# principle of 'castle, that is, the kingdom'
Principle of 'sword'
And the principle of 'melting' which is sealed by the church.
Principle of 'limb'"
<Page44>
"This is the only decrease this past three thousand years.
The church had to prepare over a century in order to seal one Ancestor. There are only two successful cases of this.
So? Do you now understand how amazing a feat it is to eliminate Vlov?"
<Page45>
"Well, it's mostly thanks to you.
Whether it's amazing or not, I'm avidly aware that I don't want to do it again."
"You can rest assured. Because there are no more ancestors in this country anymore."
<Page46>
That's good.
Rather, it would be a problem if some organization that has been planning for a century just to slay a monster would come.
If that's the case, then won't it be the turn for the JSDF?
