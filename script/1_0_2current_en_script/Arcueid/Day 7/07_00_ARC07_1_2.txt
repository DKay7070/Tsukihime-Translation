I'll keep searching the city.
Besides, we met each other in passing the first time.
There's no guarantee that I could see her if I were to go to some specific place.
If I can't rely on chance, then I'll have to make use of my own intuition and legs to spot that white back of hers.
<Page2>
"...That's right. That's what it really means to go and see a person. We rely on our phones too much."
<Page3>
Back when mobile phones weren't so widespread.
Even if you pass each other at an arranged location, you could find each other just by considering the other person's lifestyle and way of thinking.
Rather than 'animalistic instinct', it's more like an innate ability that humans possess. Even in an age where mobile phones are commonplace, there is nothing we can't do if we set out mind to it.
<Page4>
...But even if I say that, my choices are very limited.
Whether it's between the residential or the business district, I'll need to narrow my focus onto one of them.
<Page5>
"...Right."
After a brief moment of thought, I decide on the business district.
As I monitor both the north and south gate of Souya station in alternation, I'll extend my scope towards the business district as well.
<Page6>
No matter the kind of crowd, if she still remains in this city―――if that back of hers is still present, I won't let it slip away out of my sights.
<Page7>
"There's no way she's here."
There wasn't anything remotely close to an 'animalistic instinct'.
'Maybe she will be right around the corner?'
'This time she's definitely in front of the station!'
Such premonitions and hopes never came to light.
<Page8>
It's been a while since I wasted my time so magnificently like this. I might even go as far as to say that this is the first.
That's because I've tried hard not to overexert myself out of concern that my anemia could well up at any moment.
<Page9>
...With that in mind, why did I act based on such uncertainty,
choosing to do things on the off-chance that I might 'find' her without any real basis?
<Page10>
"But the night is just beginning.
I'll just search around for a little longer―――"
<Page11>
My phone receives a signal.
Who could it be? Arihiko? I take out my phone and...
<Page12>
"Shiki-san,
could you return to the mansion as quickly as possible?
For some reason or another, we seem to be graced with a sudden visitor."
<Page13>
"She seems to be a fine lady from abroad who claims to be your 'girlfriend'.
On top of the incident from this morning, Akiha-sama is also displeased at you for not returning home.
What are you trying to pull?"
<Page14>
A cryptic mail from Kohaku-san.
"―――#Huh?"
My mind goes blank.
In other words... right now, Arcueid is in the mansion?
My thoughts easily turn to the worst case scenario, which I refuse to believe.
<Page15>
I was naive. I truly was.
Why did I think that Arcueid would ever act under logical circumstances?
<Page16>
"How much more unpredictable could you possibly get?!"
In spontaneous vigor, I dash towards the Tohno residence.
<Page17>
Even the mere thought of what Arcueid could say makes me tremble in fear.
Not only that, but imagining what kind of impression Akiha would get as a result would be enough to send me to my grave!
<Page18>
Nice. I beat my personal best.
After running through the heart-breaking slopes, I arrive at the Tohno residence out of breath.
However...
<Page19>
"...*gulp*"
I calm down my breathing that had been disordered from running at full speed.
My shoulders which had been violently swinging up and down also comes to a standstill.
<Page20>
As expected, the Tohno mansion in front of me eminates a threatening aura like the opening scene of a horror film.
Or rather...
<Page21>
"Well you came at just the right time.
I hope you're fully prepared, Nii-san."
<Page22>
...Hold on.
Was it always this easy for humans to be compelled to willingly accept their own deaths?
<Page23>
However there is no path of escape for an older brother.
The situation will continue to get worse even as I falter.
I will strengthen my resolve and plunge into the demon's lair.//Up to you whether to TL 魔の洋館 more literally or not.
<Page24>
"It seems that you have finally arrived.
...Hmph. If you had arrived even a minute later, I wouldn't know what would happen."
