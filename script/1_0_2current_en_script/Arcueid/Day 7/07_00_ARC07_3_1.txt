Let's talk a little more with Arcueid.
There's still much I don't know about vampires since I decided to get rid of them.
<Page2>
"No, I'm still feeling nauseous, so I'll stay here until I feel better. In the meantime, there's something I'd like to ask you.
We may not be able to patrol the city, but we can at least do that, right?"
<Page3>
"R-really? I'm okay with it, but are you okay with that?
Humans get sleepy at night, right?"
"I don't mind. I've never been good at sleeping anyway."
<Page4>
"Never been good at it, do you have insomnia?"
"No, I can sleep just fine. It's just that I don't like it."
"Hmm. Do you ever dream?"
<Page5>
Dream......?
............No. #I don't understand any of those kind of ambiguous #things.
<Page6>
"Anyway, I'll stay with you until midnight.
If you get too tired from all the talking, I'll just head home."
<Page7>
"No. I'm not tired at all!
Rather, I'd take it with all my might!"
<Page8>
"...I-I see, I'm jealous of your energy, but don't get carried away and start rampaging again. No more punching through the ground or anything like that."
<Page9>
"I wouldn't do something so pointless.
Oh, is that what you think of me? Aren't you misunderstanding something!?"
"Don't worry, it's perfect that way, no mistakes at all. I think of you as an overeager vampire who can't take it easy."
<Page10>
Well then, I'm free to ask any question.
The question I'd like to ask you now is―――
C:> ......I want to know more about vampires.
C:> ......What are the Twenty-seven Ancestors?
C:> ......About the combat uniform for the battle against Vlov.
