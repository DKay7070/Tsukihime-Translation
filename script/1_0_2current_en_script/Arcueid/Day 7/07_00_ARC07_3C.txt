"That hurts. Dragging me outside like that, do you not have any common sense?"
She just spouted out the most repulsive words in the world.//ツラ - 顔。顔つき。現代では、やや乱暴な言い方で、多くはいい意味では用いない。Not sure if I got this right
<Page2>
"I'm the one who should be asking that! You're crazy for coming all the way to our mansion! Don't tell me that you intend to ruin my life as well, you stupid woman!"
<Page3>
"S...stupid woman? Are you trying to make fun of me?!"
"A stupid woman is stupid, is there anything wrong with what I said, you moron?! If you have any objections then say it, I'm all ears!"
"Eh? Ah... hmm?"
<Page4>
My head reaches it's boiling point.
Because this is the first time such an outrageous thing has happened, I can't settle down unless I hear the person complain in front of me.
<Page5>
"What's up with you? I just came here to see you.
I don't think it's something to be that upset about."
"...You just came to see me? Arcueid, are you being serious right now?"
<Page6>
"Y-yeah, I am. What about it?
B-Besides, there aren't any problems. I didn't even use my Mystic Eyes, and I did approach them as well as any human could.
And I didn't mention anything about your eyes or about me being a vampire to your sister as you would've wanted."
<Page7>
"You didn't have to tell me that. Even a person like you would be smart enough not to talk about that stuff."
<Page8>
"...You really are a mystery.
In that case, what are you so upset about?"
<Page9>
"It's because of how little you think!
I'm going to spell it out to you since we're here. Think about your surroundings more and pay attention to your appearances!
I'm begging you, please try to be a bit more discreet! You stand out too much just by being here!"
<Page10>
......
For now, I feel relieved after getting everything out of my chest.
Arcueid on the other hand, is the exact opposite, poised up like she has something to say.
Like a cat, Arcueid glares at me as she pouts in dissatisfaction.
<Page11>
"―――What's up with you, running your mouth like that.
Besides, what do you mean by me standing out? It's not like I can change my appearance into a human being, right?"
"A beauty like you will stand out just from existing. It doesn't matter whether or not you are human."
<Page12>
I answer her clearly.
Whether it's because my reply left no room for discourse, it seems that Arcueid has easily come to an agreement.
<Page13>
"...Well, I'll admit I went too far.
I've never experienced such a place of carnage before, so I got a bit flustered."
<Page14>
"...It's fine. Besides, it seems that I'm the one at fault here."
Arcueid nods in utmost honesty.
Somehow, I feel a sense of guilt for feeling afraid, thinking that she had some ulterior motive.
<Page15>
"...And so, why did you come all the way here?
Well, I had something that I wanted to ask you as well, so I guess this is a blessing in disguise."
<Page16>
"Is that so? I only came here just to check up on you and see how you're holding up."
"Really now? So you were just curious. Next time, hide behind a tree when you come and see me. Preferably without being spotted by anyone. And without being spotted by me if possible."
<Page17>
...I feel somewhat tired all of a sudden.
Well, this isn't the first time I've been pushed around by her own accord.
Besides, she didn't explain the situation to Akiha, and she seems to respect my position in her own way to some extent.
<Page18>
"Anyways, there is something important I need to ask you. I don't feel comfortable here, so can we go talk at some other place?"
<Page19>
"Sure, but―――what exactly did you want to ask?"
"You'll know soon enough... That's right, everyone should be at home by now, so the park might be a good place to talk."
<Page20>
I call out to her to indicate that we're leaving and begin to walk.
As Arcueid tilts her head to the side, she obediently follows along.
