Arcueid walks through the night city.
A white figure fluttering golden hair with no signs of being lost.
That image looked exactly like the first time I saw her.
Or maybe it was like the time we stood against Vlov, when she was in the midst of the broken rubble.
<Page2>
...That restless feeling I had until a moment ago had all but vanished.
There's no doubt about it. This is the hunting side of me coming into play.
<Page3>
"Arcueid."
"――――――"
Arcueid continues to walk without looking back.
<Page4>
"I told you to listen. Where do you think you're going?"
"――――――"
<Page5>
The stroll of the woman in white refuses to stop.
...It would be pathetic for me to give up at this point.
It's pathetic but... For now, I'll follow her in silence.
<Page6>
*step* *step* *step*
We continue to walk in silence, leaving only the sounds of our footsteps.
―――And then...
Arcueid stops in her tracks and turns around toward me.
<Page7>
"Stop following me. Don't you know that an ordinary human like you will just be a nuisance to me?"
<Page8>
"Sorry for being human. I'll leave if you tell me what you're planning on doing."
"...It has nothing to do with you, so scram."
<Page9>
Arcueid turns forward and begins to walk again.//ぷい - To avoid someone or something in a rude manner, and/or out of spite. Can't think of a way to add this.
...Damn it.
It looks like she's wandering about in silence yet again.
<Page10>
As we exit the downtown area and right as we approach the underground of the elevated railway with very few signs of life, Arcueid stops dead in her tracks.
<Page11>
"―――I found him."
"Huh...?"
Arcueid's voice was cold like a completely different person.
<Page12>
"――――"
...I feel a shiver down my spine.
Even from seeing her back alone, I can clearly grasp the extent of the hostile aura that surrounds her.
<Page13>
"―――What are you――"
I couldn't finish my sentence.
There was no need for her to put it into words for me to understand what she was about to do.
The thing emanating from Arcueid was, without a shadow of a doubt, her 'killing intent'.
<Page14>
"Hey―――What are you planning on doing? You...!"
"――――"
Arcueid does not respond.
In her view, there was an insignificant man in a business suit, walking.
<Page15>
"Shiki. Take off your glasses and look at that human."
"That human... you mean that man over there?"
<Page16>
"Hurry up.
If you want to know what I'm doing, then save your questions for later."
"...Fine. Although I don't really like looking at this part of town―――"
<Page17>
I take off my glasses.
"......"
A light headache emerges from my forehead.
And in exchange for that pain, I faintly see the 'lines' of the walls and the ground.
<Page18>
"Just to be certain. Those 'lines' of yours, can you see them clearly on living beings?"
"...Yeah. They're much more visible compared to non-living things."
<Page19>
"I'm sure they are. You are a living being after all, so things like the death of minerals would be incomprehensible.
Even if you could see the 'outcome' of a higher being under the category of abrasion, that doesn't mean that you are able to observe the 'end' of minerals. In order to do that, you need to have the same perspective and sense of values.//INFO DUMPS ARE CRINGE
...If you want to 'perceive' death, you have to be able to 'comprehend' life first."
<Page20>
"While we're on that note, what do you feel when you look at that human?"
"――――Hmm?"
I don't think there's anything particularly odd―――
<Page21>
"――――!?"
Reflexively, I pull my legs back.
<Page22>
...What the hell is that?
It's true that any human would have those 'lines'.
But with numbers like that, it was more like slow-streaming geometric pattern.
<Page23>
Still―――what the hell is that.
Those 'lines' are moving around his body. Like veins and arteries, those 'lines' are painted all over, so much that it was impossible to see the man's appearance.
<Page24>
"――――Gh."
I feel like throwing up.
...That was the complete opposite. It wasn't a man with lines of death, but lines of death that took the appearance of a man.
<Page25>
"What do you see, Shiki? To be honest, I would have preferred it if all you could see was a normal human being."
<Page26>
"......"
I can't reply back to Arcueid.
Right now, I'm trying my hardest not to throw up.
<Page27>
"―――I see.
That's a shame. The fact that you can see death even here."
"Ah... it's different... from usual... but... I can see... those lines..."
<Page28>
"As I thought. So you can even kill corpses.
Even a question of whether a life exists or not is irrelevant. If it moves and can be destroyed, then you can stop it, no exception―――Dear me. The one that's truly a monster is you."
"Eh―――――"
<Page29>
"It's just as you can see. That thing can no longer be called human.
It is a vampire that continues to bypass the debt of death with the blood of others."
<Page30>
Arceuid fastens her pace.
She heads in a straight line toward the man who seemed to be everywhere.
<Page31>
"Wait, Arcueid―――"
"Stay where you are, Shiki."
<Page32>
The man disappears from my sight in an instant, perhaps from noticing Arcueid's presence.
Perhaps it's more accurate to say that he leapt out of the area with superhuman speed.
<Page33>
As if in an attempt to hide, the man escapes to the darkness beneath the railway.
The figure of Arcueid had already vanished.
Inside the place illuminated by rusty lights, she too entered the darkness where no man could see past.
<Page34>
―――*thump*
I can hear the awfully close sound of my heartbeat.
<Page35>
It is hardly late in the night.
The headlight of the passing car.
The sound of the train raging overhead.
Despite being in the middle of all the noise, I could not feel any presence other than myself.
<Page36>
―――*thump*
My glasses―――I need to put on my glasses.
Otherwise I will see something unpleasant.
If I don't, it would be like staring straight into the abyss, with everything I've seen up until this point being nothing but its mere doorway.
<Page37>
―――*thump*
But my body won't move.
My naked eyes, which had seen the spattered imperfections of this world, looked upon the dark road in which Arcueid had entered in awe.
<Page38>
"―――――――"
Suddenly, the noise stops.
The sound of the wind,
and even the scent of the ground vanished.
Suddenly, everything came to a halt.
<Page39>
――――――*rustle*
Below the absolute zero temperatures of the moon.//?????
On the other side, an unfamiliar sound can be heard.
<Page40>
――――――*crack*
There's no way that I can see,
and there's nothing that can be heard.
<Page41>
――――――*fizzle*
And yet, I can see.
With these eyes, I can clearly see the sounds of clashes between the entities of death.
<Page42>
"Gh――――"
My vision is red.
Why―――can I see 'death' with these eyes when I shouldn't be?
<Page43>
"――――"
My glasses.
If I don't put on my glasses, then I don't know what will happen to my head.
Holding back the nausea gradually rising up to my throat, I put on my glasses with my trembling hand.
<Page44>
The light and sound goes back to normal.
Carefully looking at my surroundings, I find nothing abnormal below the overhead railway.
<Page45>
Despite the absence of life and limited number of passing vehicles, this place is still the same old night city.
An area of civilization where humans reside without the fear of imminent danger.
<Page46>
"*pant*――*pant*――*pant*―――"
I can't breathe well.
Even after putting on my glasses, I can still see what seems like the lingering 'death' from earlier in the corner of my eyes, making me feel disgusted.
<Page47>
"Ar...cueid?"
Arcueid comes out of the darkness, limping forward and more out of breath than I am.
<Page48>
"Shiki...? I see, so you're still here."
Turning away her beaten face, Arcueid slips through my side with a swaying motion.
Her manner of walking was reminiscient of a sick patient.
<Page49>
―――To be honest, I still haven't gotten over my nausea on my end.
But after seeing the painful look of Arcueid in front of me, those kind of things seemed to have taken care of itself.
<Page50>
"Hold on. What in the world happened to you?!"
I grab a hold of the shoulder of Arcueid who planned on departing.
With empty eyes, she slowly turns toward me.
<Page51>
"I'm fine. I'm just feeling a bit tired, so leave me be.
―――Besides, this has absolutely nothing to do with you."
<Page52>
"You idiot. If you're tired, then take a rest...!
You're sweating a lot, and it's clear that you're seriously wounded...!"
Unable to control my breath, I sigh and grab hold of her arm.
<Page53>
"...What the hell. Even if you say that, you're the one that looks like you're about to collapse."
"That's just my anemia acting up, it's nothing unusual.
If you can afford to worry about others, then worry about yourself first."
<Page54>
"―――It's fine. It's pointless even if you were to notice."
Arcueid's breathing was truly weak to the point of being pitiful.
<Page55>
"Don't tell me―――That time, when you got hurt―――"
I had never asked her if she had recovered.
After all, that was the wound she beared back when she protected me.
<Page56>
"―――――"
Arcueid continued to look down without a word.
That was not a gesture of denial, but of confirmation... or so I think.
<Page57>
"God damnit, how many times do I have to say this, you idiot!
Can you not take it easy with your current condition?!"
"...Hmph. That was... what I was... trying to do."
"Yeah right! Even if you're beyond human, there's no way you could walk when you haven't even fully recovered...!"
<Page58>
After taking notice of my serious anger, I realized something.
...I can't leave her be.
There's no way that I can let this troublesome woman go around and do as she pleases.
<Page59>
"...Arcueid, what the hell were you thinking?
Come on, don't just sit there and answer me. I'm not letting go until you talk to me!"
<Page60>
I grasp both of her white shoulders.
With her head still facing down, I saw what seemed to be a faint nod.
<Page61>
"...Geez. You're a rather persistent one, aren't you?
Fine. In that case, let's move somewhere else. That guy from earlier was a dud anyways."
<Page62>
Arcueid brushes off my arm and turns her back.
It seems that her destination is not the downtown area, but the park devoid of life.
