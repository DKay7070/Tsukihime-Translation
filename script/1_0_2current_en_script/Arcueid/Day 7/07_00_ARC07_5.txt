I return to the mansion. Since it's late at night, the lights at the mansion are completely out.
The front door is unlocked.

"...Hisui. She really did keep it open for me."
I let out a sigh out of gratitude.
In order to avoid waking up Akiha and Kohaku-san, I sneakily head inside the mansion.
<Page3>
"―――Sigh."
I take a deep breath and sit on the bed.
It's just as she said, my body is exhausted to its absolute limit.
I collapse onto the bed as if I was being absorbed.
<Page4>
"......Hah."
As I am lying down, I let out a deep breath.
...That promise with Arcueid.
Perhaps it was fate that lead me down such a dangerous path once again.
<Page5>
"...But there was no other way. I couldn't just leave her be."
Or perhaps I didn't want her to do it alone.
To let such a miraculous and beautiful creature off on her own.
<Page6>
"――――――"
How foolish of me. I already killed her with these hands once, what am I getting so fussed about?
I'm only lending her a hand in order to protect this city. This vampire is a concern for my wellbeing, so I have no choice but to cooperate. That's all.
<Page7>
"...That's right. Why else would I be doing this?"
<Page8>
...I close my eyelids.
...I take off my glasses.
My body and consciousness sinks into a deep darkness and surrenders itself to an enormous hand-like sleepiness.//Any advice on how to word this stupid ass hand metaphor would be much appreciated.
<Page9>
...In any case, I've decided to help Arcueid out once again.
I'll stop thinking about anything unnecessary for now and prepare myself for the next day――――
