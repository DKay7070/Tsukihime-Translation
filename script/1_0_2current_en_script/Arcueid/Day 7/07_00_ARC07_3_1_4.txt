This is a good opportunity. No, this is the best chance I'm going to get.
To be honest, there was something that I was really curious about...
<Page2>
"Those clothes that you wore when fighting Vlov... #show it to me."
<Page3>
I thought as much.
Of course you would make that kind of face.
But I can't stop my curiosity once it starts rolling.
<Page4>
"I couldn't see it clearly back then because it was too far.
Like, were you wearing something different then what you're wearing now?"
<Page5>
I continue to put on a facade and simply do my best to pretend that it was purely out of academic interest.
To have Arcueid feel suspicious here would be like losing a thousand pounds of gold.
<Page6>
"Ah, you mean the time I changed my appearance as a countermeasure against Vlov?
Hmm, I'm tired so I don't really want to do it, but since I still have some recipe left..."
<Page7>
"There. Is this okay with you?"
<Page8>
You're asking me if it's okay? That's not something that you can casually say after showing me something like that.
<Page9>
An elegant form without waste.
The smoothness of her silk gloves wrapped around both arms.
Her exposed shoulders are glamorous, yet neat and clean.
<Page10>
...I have no words, and it's all because of this.
A pure white beauty that could only be described as pretty standing in front of me.
<Page11>
"Waa――――――"
My puzzling sense of admiration leaks out.
This creature that stands before my eyes seems nothing like the vampire that's been thoroughly bothering me for the entire day.
Or rather she should come to the mansion once again with this dress as it would definitely make for a pretty picture.
<Page12>
"I made a mistake by choosing this dress, so I don't really like wearing it.
If I had known that Vlov's principle was 'Coldness', I would have gone with something warmer."
<Page13>
...Now that she says that, it is only the surroundings of Arcueid where the temperature is low.
It looks like ice crystals dancing and sparkling in the air.
<Page14>
"I see. So that's how you resist the heat. I guess it also serves as a cooler."
<Page15>
"Right. So don't go out of your way to touch it. Otherwise you'll get frozen as well.
This wasn't built to protect me, but to erase those flames back when I grappled with Vlov."
<Page16>
So in theory, she can defend herself while attacking at the same time.
That really is something that she would do.
But even so, that appearance...
I don't want to admit this, but...
she truly is a princess. This woman...
<Page17>
"Geez. What's up with that difficult look on your face?
Don't tell me that you're enjoying yourself from looking at my blunder?"
<Page18>
"As if I would do that. If that's a blunder, then 90% of the things in this world are one. Having this appearance regularly... would be no good. It would stand out too much.
Besides it would be ridiculous to let other people see this. That is a right only I should have."
<Page19>
"R-Really now? So you're saying, that you like it?"
Suddenly, I feel calm.
I let out a careless remark from such a minor assault.
<Page20>
"W-Well in a way I guess. Back when we fought together, I was able to rely on you for various things after all."
I'll try to save myself somehow.
But whether it was because she was delighted by my use of the phrase 'rely on you', Arcueid responds―――
<Page21>
"Of course! I'm basically good at everything after all!
I'll do my best to support you who's bad at everything else but killing!"
<Page22>
"――――――"
...I think I just flicked on a strange sense of confidence inside her.
<Page23>
This woman, she definitely said that with the imagery of hitting me like a tennis ball...
Perhaps it was my fault for coming up with such an unreasonable plan during the fight with Vlov...
<Page24>
"By the way, do those clothes have a name or anything?"
"A name? I don't usually decide those things one-by-one...
I guess the dress code is, well... something like 'Clad in Glaciers'?
That's the sort of image I had when creating this."
<Page25>
"Hmm. Then if you had seen through Vlov's power―――"
"Then I would have an image of Kilauea. After all, that is still an active volcano even today."
I would have loved to see something cute like a dress code of 'A Hawaiian Me' on her.
<Page26>
"Hey, can I change back now?
I don't like to waste energy after all."
...It's disappointing, but I can't think of any more reasons to stop her.
I try my best to remain calm and reply with 'Go ahead'.
But be that as it may...
<Page27>
"Hey, why did you choose a dress as a combat uniform against Vlov?
It's not like we were going to a formal party."
<Page28>
"Hmm? But isn't that where we went?"
"―――#I see."
It seems that in the world of vampires, that is what they would consider a formal party.
