<Page1>
After being released from that so-called one-sided handshake, the time is almost 9PM.
<Page2>
My head hurts from thinking about what I'll do when I get home, but now that I've decided to help, I cannot go back yet.
This is where the vampire extermination plan really begins.
<Page3>
"...So now what do we do?
Perhaps we should keep walking around and searching for the dead?"
<Page4>
"Yeah. If we wipe out all the dead in this city, then its master will have no choice but to come out of hiding.
It's the only thing we can do right now, but..."
Arcueid gives me a look, asking me if that's really okay with me.
<Page5>
"Whether it's okay or not, I'll follow whatever you think is right. After all, every man knows his own business best."
<Page6>
As I say that,
Arcueid looks at me with a big grin on her face.
<Page7>
"What? Did I say something strange just now?"
"Nope. I was just thinking of how honest you are."
"......"
...I should be more stern with her from now on.
I feel like if I let her have her way, she'll ask me to do something outrageous once again.
<Page8>
"Let's go. We can walk around the city, right? Maybe we should check someplace like that tunnel again from earlier."
<Page9>
"No, we don't have to visit that area again.
These dead follow their own pre-determined route in order to not consume each other and avoid having the victims being concentrated in one place.
It's already decided how much the dead are going to eat tonight. I don't think we'll find any more after the last one, but... Since you're already here, we might as well search for a little longer."
<Page10>
"So they avoid consuming each other... They really are being fully commanded. I've always thought that they were more indiscriminate."
<Page11>
"If we look at it from their master's perspective, the gathering of blood is not seen as a form of amusement, but as necessary work in order to stay alive. In his case, routine work is a good thing."
<Page12>
"So it's like precious labor, huh? But in that case, wouldn't he have some measures in place?
Since you're here dwindling his numbers, maybe he'll increase them from here on out, or maybe he'll withdraw the dead and go into hiding..."
<Page13>
"In other words, he's a 'stingy' type, right?
But as a vampire, he has no choice but to extract the life and blood of others if he wants to survive.
Even if I know that he's going after me, he still has to deploy the dead in order to obtain the bare minimum amount of food."
<Page14>
...I see.
So what Arcueid was doing was a form of siege warfare.
<Page15>
Finding out where the master is sleeping in the city is far too difficult.
That's why instead of finding him, we have to lure him out.
The master, whose vital labor force and source of nutrients are cut off, will have no choice but to eventually act on his own behalf.
<Page16>
And once he goes on the move, Arcueid will be able to sense the vampire's presence.
...That's where the vampire slaying comes in.
Just like the time we killed Vlov, we'll face him head on and eliminate the one behind all these incidents.
<Page17>
"I understand the situation. For now, we should walk around the town when it becomes night and search for any dead that are still active, right?"
<Page18>
"Yeah. On that note, Shiki. I'd like you to take off your glasses when you're accompanying me, is that okay?"
"You want me to take off my glasses? ...But why?"
<Page19>
"Because it's more reliable that way.
I can sense the presence of human and non-human beings.
You can see the difference between the living and the dead with those eyes.
It's not like we have many other ways of finding them, right?"
<Page20>
"―――――"
...I understand what Arcueid is trying to say.
I was the one that said we should cooperate, so it's not like I can refuse.
But moving around without my glasses on is―――
<Page21>
"It puts too much burden on your body, doesn't it?
But this is a good chance, so I want to confirm something one more time.
If you think it's okay, then take off your glasses and follow me."
<Page22>
...So she wants me to walk around the city without my glasses.
In the past seven years since I've received these glasses, I have never once tried something like that.
<Page23>
Besides, I get a headache just from looking at things, so it's easy to imagine what would happen if I walked around the city in that state.
Even so―――
<Page24>
"......"
...It's fine. It should just be a headache at most.
Compared to the pain that Arcueid endured, this shouldn't be that big of a deal.
<Page25>
"It's fine. I'll follow you without my glasses on.
If it makes things easier, then it's a no-brainer."
<Page26>
"―――I see. In that case, let's get moving."
I take a single deep breath, take off my glasses, and walk towards the city.
<Page27>
Walking side-by-side with Arcueid, we travel among the crowd of people.
I haven't walked on such a scribble sprawled scenery since the time I got hospitalized.
<Page28>
"――――"
I don't feel any dizziness so far.
It seems that looking at things alone won't give me a headache.
However, it isn't the thin lines of the building, but the lines of the people walking across the street that make me feel sick.
<Page29>
...I can't help but have such unpleasant feelings come to mind.
'Those line-infested humans make me sick'.
My nausea rises up as if to remind me that these humans are such fragile creatures that are so easily killable.
<Page30>
We walk around the night city.
Without a word, Arcueid continues to march forward like she knew where to go.
<Page31>
For about two hours, we visited every prominent place around the station.
In the end, we didn't manage to even find a single person that contained such abnormal lines.
<Page32>
"Shiki, you can put on your glasses now.
As I thought, there aren't any more dead tonight."
<Page33>
I put on my glasses#.
With my vision going back to normal, I feel a sense of relief.
<Page34>
"Is it really okay to give up so easily? We've only looked around the city once."
<Page35>
"Yeah, one time is more than enough. When it comes to presence, most of it came from the remains of that place. But there was no sign of the dead in the city.
It could be that the one from before was the last of the dead collecting food. From here on out, we're destroying the higher rank dead."
<Page36>
"...You seem upset, Arcueid."
"Of course I am. I completely missed even though you came all this way for me. Sigh. I really wanted to show you my cool side."
<Page37>
"――――――"
......
Hearing that's the reason for her being upset is... a bit embarassing.
<Page38>
"I-I mean, it doesn't really matter even if it was a waste... If you're really that upset, then I don't mind going around the city again.
I'll also focus my attention when looking this time. You never know when you might find something."
<Page39>
"No. I can't let you push yourself any further tonight."
"I mean, I don't feel like I'm being pushed that much..."
<Page40>
"But you are. You just haven't realized it. Even now, your completely blue in the face. Come on, sit on a bench. You'll feel a little better that way, right?"
<Page41>
Arcueid hurriedly urges me to sit down.
Well to be fair, I do feel like I'm about to throw up, so I'll take a seat for the time being. And then...
<Page42>
"Ah..."
My voice leaks out from the small amount of comfort.
Perhaps sitting down released my tension, or maybe the fatigue that had accumulated came all at once... I feel good even though my shoulders are heavy, proving that I had indeed pushed myself.
<Page43>
"...Thanks, I needed that.
But this is nothing compared to the headaches I've had until now. It's not even that dangerous compared to the dizziness that broke my consciousness..."
<Page44>
With the night breeze hitting me, I take a deep breath, and with a little rest, my nausea will fade in due time.
My pain is nothing compared to the wounds of Arcueid.
That's why you don't have to worry―――#Arcueid?
<Page45>
"You're a frail creature, so don't push yourself.
You think you're fine just because you didn't faint? You're wrong. Your eyes cant't distinguish between what's strong and weak.
Don't push yourself to look at things you're not accustomed to. If you overwork your brain like that, there's a chance of turning into a cripple."
"...A cripple? Who is?"
<Page46>
"I'm talking about you! Why don't you feel any sense of danger?!"
Even though you possess such rare Mystic Eyes, there's a limit on how much of a pacifist or tasty prey you can be! I'm surprised that you've survived this long. Under normal circumstances, you would have been eaten up in no time!"
<Page47>
...Under what country would that be considered normal?
Or rather, I'd appreciate it if you stop underestimating one of the most law-abiding countries in the world. Even if you call me a peace-loving idiot, isn't it amazing that we've maintained this level of peace for so long?
<Page48>
"...Fine. I didn't want to do this, but I'll explain this properly to you."
<Page49>
"Listen. I told you that it's easy to see the death of living things and that it's difficult to see the death of minerals, right?
That's because it's a problem of the circuits in your brain.
The death of things. When you observe its cause and effect, what you're actually doing is not seeing, but something closer to that of predicting."
<Page50>
"All phenomenon stems from a cause, a single absolute truth.//Type moon lore experts, take the wheel, i am DONE
An end point born from the beginning of this universe.
Within it, there exists a thing that contains a record of everything. Rather than a record, it is closer to 'existence' itself, so it can't be called information. It is simply 'existence'. That in itself holds no purpose, nor does it have a course of action. All it does is release causes, like a whirlpool of roots."//what the fuck are you smoking nasu
<Page51>
"What you see in this world is what flowed from that whirlpool and derived until it took its current form. You, me, vampires, humans, we're all nothing but atoms that came as a result of that.
...Although we've become far too removed and complex to return to the origin that is the beginning, in any case, you understand that such a single 'truth' exists, right?"
<Page52>
"But for example, no matter how far removed we are from the origin, as long as we exist in some form of its derivation, we are still connected to it even if it's by a very tiny thread."
<Page53>
"The root of all things. A record of the beginning and the end of everything.
By being connected to it, it would mean possessing the knowledge of the end of all things.
The brain of higher animals are capable of receiving and transmitting, but for most humans, those circuits are closed only to themselves. However, there are also some humans that have potentially opened those circuits. Humans that are capable of supernatural phenomenon without the use of magic circuits even though they are not part of a transcendent species."//Have fun fitting this in the page lmao
<Page54>
"This is what the mages classify as a Psychic.
A human born as a mutant possessing some form of magic circuits.
―――For example, a human who has never studied Mystics but is able to see the 'death of things'."
<Page55>
"――――――"
...No, I'm sorry, Arcueid.
I know you've gone out of your way to tell me this, but my brain cannot keep up with this conversation at all.
<Page56>
"It's fine. You don't have to understand any of it.
The only thing I wanted to say was that you shouldn't force yourself to look at things you don't want to look at.
I can't say for certain since I can't see it, but I'm sure that those 'lines' aren't the only things you can see. Apart from those 'lines', you can see a 'point' that contains the origin, right?"
"――――――"
<Page57>
...That's exactly right.
Focusing only on the lines, I can see something like a point if I look closely enough. In fact, during the last moment against Vlov, there was a 'point' like a giant whirlpool in his body.
<Page58>
Now that I think back, that wasn't the only time I saw it.
Although most of the time I would lose consciousness from the shock like my brain stem was being cut, I could definitely see the point.
<Page59>
"...That's right. #That time―――I definitely saw those points when I killed you as well. There were so many of them, and the lines flowed as if the points were connected to each other."
<Page60>
To use a metaphor, it was like a blood vessel.
If those lines are the veins, then those points are something that produces those veins.
<Page61>
" 'Lines that give rise to death' and 'death' itself... I wonder what it all means.
...If you really wanted to, I think it's possible for you to see the death of minerals. But in order to do that, your brain needs to open its circuits from the category of living beings to minerals so you can understand its death.
But in reality, that is an impossible task. If you overwork your brain like that, they will definitely become unusable."
<Page62>
...Become unusable, huh.
"Do you mean that these eyes won't be able to see death anymore?"
<Page63>
"Absolutely not. Shiki, what do you think happens to an engine that's overblown from being pushed too hard?"
"It would become junk, right? Once an engine is burned out, it can no longer be used again――――"
<Page64>
Ah, so that's what she meant.
In other words, the headaches I get from looking at death is the same as an engine that screams from going too fast.
<Page65>
"Do you get it now? If you're just looking at things, then there's no problem, but you should stop looking at things that shouldn't be seen.
I suggest that you try your best to stop when it gets to the point where your blood vessels burst and puts a strain on your brain. If you go any further, you might end up living the rest of your days as a stone."
<Page66>
"You should show some appreciation to the magician that created those glasses for you.
Most psychics that use their abilities without knowing its dangers end up turning themselves into a cripple.
...Well, even though they're human, they are considered unsuitable to live in the eyes of human society, so perhaps they are better off that way."
<Page67>
"―――――"
"That seems to be the reason I'm here.//Copied lines directly from prologue. Might need to reword it to sound better.
I'll give you your old life back."
<Page68>
Sensei said those words and created these glasses for me.
...There's so much that I have to thank her for that it makes my heart ache.
That person, in so many ways, had saved the current me on that day seven years ago.
<Page69>
"By the way."
"Uwah?!"
<Page70>
Arcueid peers into my face from the side while I was engrossed in deep feelings.
That was bad for my heart.
We just had a good talk, so I would have liked it if she had been a bit more respectful.
<Page71>
"What do you want? If it's about the glasses, I'm not handing them over."
"It's not that.
What do you want to do now? It doesn't seem like there'll be any more dead tonight, so do you want to call it a day?"
<Page72>
"......"
The time is now 11PM.
The curfew of the Tohno residence has been broken long since.
I'll―――
C:>Talk with Arcueid a little longer.
C:>...That's right, I should get going now.
