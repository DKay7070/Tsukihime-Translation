 ―――White.
    White brings back nostalgic memories.
    Things I had forgotten.
    Something I had to forget.
    What my father ordered me to forget.

A hot day in summer.
Blue sky and huge, huge cumulonimbus clouds.
With a swaying landscape
The sound of cicadas that seems to make me dizzy.
The sound of cicadas.
<Page3>
Miiin minmin
Miiin minmin
Miiin minmin
It's so noisy I want to die.
In the open air are the husks of cicadas.
The sun seems to be right next to me.
The area seems to be slowly burning.
<Page4>
A hot day in the middle of summer.
It was as if the world had turned into a frying pan.

Akiha is crying.
Akiha, who's always been quiet and always followed me,
is crying.

There was a child lying on the ground in the courtyard.
His white shirt is stained red, and he doesn't move at all.
I'm looking down at it.
My hands are as red as the fallen child.
No, actually.
These hands that are red from the blood of the fallen child.
<Page6>
"■■―――――"
The adults are coming.
They notice the terrible situation and come in ready to kill.
<Page7>
"What the hell happened―――――"
The adults take Akiha with them.
The fallen child remains dead.
In the distant sky, there are white, white clouds.
I was left alone, looking up at the summer sky in a daze.
<Page8>
"You killed him――――"
The adults are screaming.
They're shouting my name, the name of the one who killed their child.
They're keep shouting out two words like they were out of their minds.
Just two syllables.
The adults all called me Shiki and restrained me when my hands were stained red.
<Page9>
I still don't understand that.
You kill what you can.
You kill things that are alive.
What the hell is wrong with that?
<Page10>
I opened my closed eye lids.
I felt like I was seeing a nostalgic dream that I couldn't quite make sense of.
<Page11>
"...............'
I'm in my room.
I―――I only remember getting up to the main gate, but it seems that I somehow returned to this room.
<Page12>
My brain still isn't working.
The events of last night come back to me in a chaotic fashion.
I can't sort out everything because it's impossible, but if I had to think of one thing in particular, it would be...
C:> It's about Arcueid.
C:> It's about the man in black.
C:> It's about Noel-sensei.......
