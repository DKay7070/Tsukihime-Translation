After thinking for a while about what to do, I decided to take my first walk around the mansion in seven years.
Let's go around the second floor for now.
<Page2>
The Tohno residence is divided into an east wing and a west wing.
In the east wing is the office of the head of the family, and behind that is Akiha's private room. In other words, this is her living area.
......I'm rather hesitant to go there, so let's go around the west wing today.
<Page3>
I enter the corridor of the west wing.
The passage to the immediate right leads to the lobby.
If you go straight ahead, you'll find yourself in the center of the west wing.
By the way, the room I just exited is Tohno Shiki's room.
<Page4>
The rooms along this corridor are all quite empty.
They were probably occupied by relatives when Makihisa was still alive.
<Page5>
"The dead end up ahead, I believe it is......"
It is probably Tohno Makihisa's office.

「..................」
Arcueid's words from last night came to mind.
"You're not the only one who's special, your family tree is..."
<Page7>
......It's ridiculous.
It's a ridiculous story, but she would never say so without proof.
I'll...
C:> ......check out Makihisa's office.
C:> ......No, I can't do that.
