――――My life has been unfortunate.
I remember the scene from yesterday when I killed Arcueid.
<Page2>
A time filled with the stench of blood and death.
I don't want to go through something like that ever again.
If I stay with Arcueid, the same thing will definitely happen again. If I don't want that, I have no choice but to go back to the mansion.
<Page3>
"――――――"
...There's a problem with that choice though.
Knowing what it was and what I did wrong as a person, I keep a lid on my thoughts.
I am not running away.
I tell myself that I'm just returning to the way things were.
<Page4>
"...I'll go back to the mansion. If I do that, then surely..."
By the time dawn breaks I'm sure that out there, in a place that's no longer any of my concern, some sort of conclusion will have been reached.
<Page5>
"Hey you. Do you have a second?"
"Eh?"
Just as I was about to get up from the bench, a voice called out to me from behind.
<Page6>
"Normally I'd leave you alone, but you have such a pathetic look on your face."
<Page7>
There is a girl standing there. I don't think I've ever seen her before, but she seems familiar.
She seems to be a middle school student, but she isn't wearing a uniform. I wonder if she is skipping school like I am.
<Page8>
"....What exactly is pathetic?"
"Your face. It has the same color as clay. That's the kind of face people have when they die, right?"
<Page9>
"――――――"
Even as a joke, that's in poor taste.
I can't laugh off what she just said.
The girl is staring at me, not seeming to care that I have taken it so seriously.
<Page10>
"I'm not joking, I'm speaking based on experience. The grandpa of someone I know stopped breathing three hours after his face started looking like that. If I had called an ambulance, maybe he could have been saved."
<Page11>
The girl doesn't come close to me.
She keeps her distance, staying about a meter away.
<Page12>
"Do you want me to call an ambulance?
In that case, lend me your phone. I don't want to use mine for this."
<Page13>
"―――,# Ha."
A breath of relief escaped my lips at the unexpected offer.
Just as the girl says, it seems that I had sunk into a malaise without noticing.
<Page14>
I snap back to the real world and my breathing returns to normal.
<Page15>
"No, I'm fine. It's just some mild anemia, it'll pass soon.
―――But even so, thanks for calling out to me. That was a real help."
<Page16>
"I see. I'll leave you to it then.
...Your health, has it always been this bad?"
"?"
Just as she says her farewells, the girl asks me a strange question.
<Page17>
"...Well, I was born with it, I guess.
Ever since I was a kid, if I exercise even a little, I end up getting dizzy."
"Hmm. I guess dogs are out of the question then. You can't play with them after all."
"No, just going for a walk isn't really a problem."
I don't have any desire to get a dog, but it's kind of sad to completely deny the possibility.
<Page18>
"A walk....
Your face is still pale. I suggest that you go home quickly and get some rest."
<Page19>
The girl walks away.
"Huh...?"
As she left, I somehow got the feeling that her physical condition was far more dire than my own.
<Page20>
In the end, I rest at the park for a while before heading home.
As the sun set, it became pitch black outside.
<Page21>
It is past seven in the evening.
The curfew of the mansion is eight o'clock, so if I don't hurry home, Akiha will give me a hard time again.
<Page22>
The streets around the mansion are as empty as ever.
Even though the sun has just set, it is as quiet as if it were midnight.
<Page23>
"Speaking of which, this place is..."
This is the place where I came to check on the noisy dog the night I came back to the mansion.
<Page24>
"?"
Right now, right in front of me, there's something resembling a black lump of meat.
<Page25>
"――――――"
My consciousness freezes.
Why are those here, I wonder.
It's obvious, I realize.
<Page26>
It wasn't just Arcueid who was spotted in the alleyway.
The person that was with her would also become a target for capture.
Didn't I block out my thoughts so that I wouldn't be aware of that fact?
<Page27>
As if to make up for the delay, I take out my knife.
At the edge of the street... I step back, keeping my eyes on the corpses that emerged from the thicket.
At that moment―――
<Page28>
――――That's strange.
Suddenly, the whole area turned a bright red.
<Page29>
I hear a rumbling sound.
It's coming from somewhere very close.
My entire body leaps in pain like a released spring.
I'm thrashing around again and again.
My consciousness, my body, my vision, the world,
are all spinning like an emergency light.
<Page30>
Rumble. Rumble. Rumble.
The sound.
Somehow, it seems to be coming from my body.
<Page31>
"■■■■■―――!"
I fall to the asphalt.
I can't move my arms or legs. There's nothing left to move.
Only pain is running through my eyes.
<Page32>
"―――A lack of warmth.
You weren't even a dog that could protect its own master."
<Page33>
I hear a hoarse voice.
The sound of grease bursting out onto the asphalt.
I didn't realize until the very end that this was the remains of the filth that had poured out of me.
