"――――――"
I look down at what used to be a living thing.
I remove the dog's jaw from around my arm with ease.
"―――――――Wow. It hardly bit into it at all."
<Page2>
I look at my bloody arm.
There are bite marks on my school uniform, but the gouged flesh is no more than a centimeter deep.
<Page3>
The majority of the blood belongs to the black dog whose head I had pierced.
The pain I felt when I had been bitten had been minor, but my fear had made it seem many times worse than it was.
<Page4>
"――――――Hah"
I lie down on the ground and look up at the ceiling.
My head hurts.
The world has become frayed at the edges, and I can see the lines of death poking through here and there.
My hands and feet are completely chilled, but my sense of reasoning is feverish.
<Page5>
"―――Haha, ha"
Right next to me are the corpses of the two black dogs.
One of my arms is covered in blood while the other is grasping a red knife.
...In addition, there are countless human corpses lying around on the lower floors.
<Page6>
I can't help but laugh.
Because none of this is real.
There's no way any of this could be real.
Therefore I must be normal.
I'm completely normal without a shadow of a doubt.
The only thing that's crazy is this dream I'm having. As soon as I wake up, everything will go back to normal.
<Page7>
Ah, but―――how long have I been dreaming with my eyes wide open like this―――?
