<Page1>
*ding dong*
A terribly out-of-place sound rings.
"Ele... vator...?"
Another box arrives right next to the one from earlier.
My exhausted brain cannot comprehend the meaning of it.
<Page2>
The door opens.
Even though my brain is not functioning properly, my body automatically places the knife back in my right hand and stands up to face the tragedy that is awaiting.
<Page3>
...Ah, I feel sick.
Once again, an iron box opens.
Inside it, there is...
<Page4>
"――――――Nothing?"
There is nothing inside.
<Page5>
...Anticlimactic yet again, I suppose.
The danger has passed.
Even though it was already all over, I can grasp the situation of the floor below.
Right as I was about to turn my back knowing that there was no reason to be here anymore,
<Page6>
"Ah, hah, any, one, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone!"
A comically absurd female voice rings out.
The voice along with her footsteps grow louder and louder.
<Page7>
There's no doubt about it.
There is a survivor running up the stairs, gasping for breath...!
<Page8>
"Ha, ha, ha... Thank goodness, it's not burning here...!"
I can hear her cries of joy.
The sound of footsteps does not stop.
The source of the voice tumbles into the elevator hall.
<Page9>
"You! Hey, you over there!"
Noticing my presence in the hallway, the woman begins to run once again.
<Page10>
"Thank goodness, I'm saved...! I'm finally saved...!"
Her face that had been tense with fear begins to radiate with joy.
<Page11>
"Eh...?"
A pale hand appears and drags that hope back into the depths of hell.
"No way...no, no, NOOOOO!"
She stares at me, as her voice continues to beg for help.
<Page12>
There is no resistance.
The woman is restrained with ease.
As soon as she's grabbed by those hands, the woman loses consciousness as if she's waking up from a dream.
<Page13>
―――Stop.
―――Stop right there.
―――That woman.# ―――She has nothing to do with us,# she's just an innocent woman.
―――Don't feed on her, at the very least.
<Page14>
"Sto―――!"
My plea does not make it in time.
It wouldn't make a difference even if it did.
<Page15>
I stare at the woman's neck.
Her eyes look like there are stars scattered inside.
Unprecedented rage sharpens my vision.
Two bottomless eyes cloaked with bloody resentment.
<Page16>
The woman's limbs twitch as if they are being sucked on.
"Ah... aah, ah―――"
Her face shrivels as her emotions and vitality are stolen.
<Page17>
This must be the first time I've ever seen such a scene.
Despite seeing it for the first time, there is no need for an explanation to understand what is taking place.
<Page18>
Even the gulping sounds can be heard.
After a long period of feasting, the man casually discards her body.
The woman falters like a withered tree.
A ballerina dancing narrowly on the brink of death.
On her wretched-looking back...
<Page19>
There are no screams.
Only the sound of bloodshed echos through the air.
Her pulverized back.
A shower of blood.
The vampire breaths out in satisfaction as he bathes in it.
<Page20>
The world changes drastically.
The apparent temperature finally matches that of reality.
A layer of flame envelops the corridor.
Like a river rushing through a dam.
<Page21>
My skin fizzles and burns.
If I breathe now, my lungs will surely be burned.
<Page22>
But something's wrong.
They're burning. The flames are definitely flickering.
<A|・><n|・><d|・> <y|・><e|・><t|・> <t|・><h|・><e|・> <b|・><u|・><i|・><l|・><d|・><i|・><n|・><g|・> <i|・><s|・> <n|・><o|・><t|・> <b|・><e|・><i|・><n|・><g|・> <b|・><u|・><r|・><n|・><e|・><d|・>.
The only one that can feel the flames is me, the sole survivor.
<Page23>
I feel a headache.
The man starts walking towards me.
He is the one behind the river of flames.
The closer he gets, the hotter the atmosphere becomes.
<Page24>
There are only 15 meters left.
I am unable to breathe even at this distance.
In other words, any living thing that gets approached by this man will simply die as a result.
<Page25>
The slim figure walks toward me.
The man carries a strange appearance. A mixture of elegant, traditional-style clothing underneath the barbarian overcoat.
While he has the appearance of a human, it is clear that he is nothing like one.
Everything is out of sync. I'm about to go crazy.
13 meters.
He strides towards me in complete silence.
<Page26>
"―――"
I prepare my knife and glare at the man.
No response. I wonder if he can even see me in the first place.
10 meters.
I stare at the man.
Within the midst of the excited flames, the lines of death come into vision.
<Page27>
"―――"
The inside of my skull boils like soup.
<Page28>
<W|・><h|・><a|・><t|・> <t|・><h|・><e|・> <h|・><e|・><l|・><l|・> <i|・><s|・> <t|・><h|・><a|・><t|・>?
An intricate, swirling, dense torrent of death.
Shining brightly in the midst of it all like a jewel―――
<Page29>
"Gh...!"
I turn my eyes away from the excessive headache.
That is bad news. It would be bad to continue looking at that point in the man's center.
It's like looking directly at the sun and burning your retina.
My brain will explode if I look at <t|・><h|・><a|・><t|・> <t|・><h|・><i|・><n|・><g|・> without being prepared.
<Page30>
8 meters.
The distance is narrowing.
The temperature is rising. But it's still not hot enough to burn my flesh.
<Page31>
6 meters.
The man stops at that distance.
His gaze focuses on me. The man finally notices me at this close range.
<Page32>
―――Our eyes meet.
<I|・> <s|・><h|・><o|・><u|・><l|・><d|・> <n|・><o|・><t|・> <b|・><e|・> <m|・><a|・><k|・><i|・><n|・><g|・> <e|・><y|・><e|・> <c|・><o|・><n|・><t|・><a|・><c|・><t|・> <w|・><i|・><t|・><h|・> <h|・><i|・><m|・>.
The warning of the white woman comes to mind.
But I can't take my eyes off him.
I cannot ignore the bottomless void in front of me.
<Page33>
That can't be right. This must be fundamentally different from the Mystic Eyes that the white woman talked about. These eyes don't have the power to paralyze a person. Because they are eyes of madness. They're the eyes of a madman. An ugly and pitiful being that flourishes on his own abnormality and is driven by nothing but his impulses. A bastard just like me―――
<Page34>
"...!"
My instincts tell me I'm in danger.
Alarm bells ring inside my head.
But my body still won't move. Not even a single fingertip responds.
<Page35>
Danger signals ricket around my skull.
No matter what means or methods I use, I must get away from here immediately, or else my life will come to an end.
<Page36>
―――But it was already too late.
The sickly-eyed man, without even acknowledging my existence,
burns me to death with his 'hand'.
<Page37>
"――――"
I'm dead.
After all, these flames are the real deal.
The blue flames in the hallway are just an effect that manifests outside of reality.
I would not die in an instant even if I was swallowed by it. Perhaps it's a kind of phantom pain that only scorches the life force.
<Page38>
But this is different.
These flames are real. Just getting close to them will be enough to burn my skin. Life will turn into ash from just a single touch.
It is released in the shape of sharp claws.
<Page39>
My body will be cut in two from the waist and burn from its cross-section.
An outcome as clear as day.
And yet, just before that.
<Page40>
I was pulled backward at the same time as the sound of the thud.
<Page41>
"―――Arcueid...?"
The sound of utter disbelief escapes my throat.
My thoughts turn blank.
<Page42>
I understand the situation.
I was pulled back by Arcueid, and at the same time, she stepped in front of me and took the blow of that 'hand'.
<Page43>
Her action makes no sense to me whatsoever.
After all, I was the one who was supposed to act as a shield.
So why is she hurting herself in order to protect me...?
<Page44>
"――――!"
Arcueid's face twists in agony.
<Page45>
The flaming hands reach out again and again.
There is no need to pull me back this time.
Arcueid swings her right hand to blow away the flames just as she did in the alleyway.
<Page46>
But it's not perfect.
The flames can't be extinguished, and the after-effect scorches her skin.
You're telling me... that even a person like Arcueid can get burned by a direct hit...?
<Page47>
Is the temperature so hot that it's lethal even to her, the woman furthest away from death...!?
<Page48>
It all happened in a mere five seconds.
The number of shots fired and intercepted was about ten.
For whatever reason, the man solemnly lowers his arms.
<Page49>
"......"
The man stares at Arcueid in silence.
Arcueid glares back at the man in pain, her stomach dyed with a deep red.
<Page50>
The man has only Arcueid in his sight.
He treats me, the knife holding guy that she protected, as if I am completely non-existent.
<Page51>
"........"
Vapor rises from his mouth.
After expelling his breath, the man reaches under his coat with his left hand.
<Page52>
I hear a faint metallic click.
There's no doubt about it. That was the sound of a blade.
There's a long object hidden under that coat. It must be the one that was used to slash the woman in front of the elevator.
<Page53>
The man moves his legs.
With the blade still hidden under his coat, he tries to take a step towards Arcueid.
<Page54>
"Insolent fool. If thou art not a pig, speak thy name.
Or wast thy <p|・><a|・><r|・><e|・><n|・><t|・><s|・> too distemperate to teachest thee the most basic of manners?"
"――――――"
<Page55>
The man's legs stop in their tracks.
His ghostly eyes light up with ego.
He makes a gasping sound in response to Arcueid's words... words that I cannot properly understand.
His voice resonates a painful aura as if he had forgotten that he was a living creature until now.
<Page56>
"...I am well aware of such etiquette.
But I have yet to possess a name to provide to someone like yourself."
<Page57>
"You may not have any manners, but it seems that you can feel some shame at least.
So you have lost your original name, huh... but you do have something to be called by, do you not? You may have just joined recently, but you're still a <p|・><a|・><r|・><t|・> <o|・><f|・> <t|・><h|・><e|・> <A|・><n|・><c|・><e|・><s|・><t|・><o|・><r|・><s|・>."
<Page58>
...The atmosphere changes.
The intensity of the blue flames burning in the hallway skyrockets.
Did Arcueid's words strike some nerve in the man?
<Page59>
"―――Vlov."
With a troubled expression, the flame spreading vampire says,
"Vlov Arkhangel."
With that, the man reveals his own name.
<Page60>
"An unfamiliar name. Since I have no record of you, then you must not be a legitimate successor. Could it be that your master got destroyed?"
"...That is not true. I was the one that killed my master."
<Page61>
"So then you became the new Ancestor.
In that case, did you want the honor of killing me next?"
"...Honor, is something that exists within me.
I will... I will take away nothing but the things I desire."
<Page62>
"As admirable as your determination may be, you should have focused that desire on me alone.
This is a bit over the top."
"...No. This city is rotten to the core.
If I do not burn it to the ground, it would go against everything that I believe in."
"Oh really. In other words, you are just like all those other third-rate Dead Apostles then."
<Page63>
"...I am well aware of my crude nature.
Princess of the True Ancestors. That heart of yours, shall be mine."
<Page64>
"...!"
Vlov. The vampire known by that name distorts the surroundings.
The 'sea of flames' overflow around him with great magnitude.
Arcueid's body acts as a breakwater, preventing me from being swallowed by the raging stream.
<Page65>
"...Don't move, Shiki. That flame is his weapon.
If you don't want to be turned to ash, then stay behind me."
<Page66>
As much as I appreciate her advice, I can't help but feel a sense of unease that I can't put into words.
...That is his weapon? Really?
Because after creating such a high-temperature environment, it's as though his true form is like―――
<Page67>
No, now is not the time to think.
I focus my attention and grasp the knife.
<Page68>
―――It's coming.
The hallway is now a cave of fire.
Just as Vlov was about to unleash the blade from under his coat―――
<Page69>
"...Huh?"
―――This happens.
The man turns his back from us all of a sudden.
<Page70>
He walks to the hall as if nothing happened, gets on the elevator with the same amount of composure, and leaves this floor.
<Page71>
"Wha―――"
I don't understand any of this anymore...!
Not the two dogs that attacked me, not the flames that covered the corridor, and not the nightmarish reality that warped this hotel!
<Page72>
"Shi―――ki."
Arcueid drops onto me with a thud.
...It's a nasty wound. The bleeding from her stomach stopped, but her face is contorted in pain.
<Page73>
―――It happened just a few seconds ago.
It was the wound she got while protecting me from that man.
<Page74>
"That's right... why, did you...?"
<Page75>
"...Yeah, I underestimated him a bit.
I thought I could save you and simply get away in that situation, but#―――# as expected of you, Shiki.
Those wounds that you inflicted on me were worse than I thought."
<Page76>
Arcueid gives off a smile jokingly as her face contorts in pain.
<Page77>
"――――――"
I can't look at her.
Even though she's in pain from protecting me along with the fact that I was responsible for the pain in the first place―――If she looks at me with that idiotic smile of hers, I don't know how I'm supposed to respond.
<Page78>
Arcueid leans her body against mine and gently closes her eyes.
<Page79>
"Wait a minute, what are you closing your eyes for, you idiot!
Get a hold of yourself. You're supposed to be an invincible vampire at night, aren't you!?"
<Page80>
"...Yeah... but... it seems... that I'm at my limit."
"Wha――――"
"I'm sorry, but I need you to take me to my room."
<Page81>
Arcueid collapses on me.
Her weight falls onto my arm as I hold her.
"―――Wait a minute, you can't be―――"
If you go ahead and die right now, I really won't know how to respond...!
<Page82>
"No, you can't. Wake up, Arcueid...!"
I call out to her, whose eyes are shut.
And then.
"...Zzz-"
She seems so happy in her sleep that I feel foolish for having said that a second ago.
<Page83>
"......"
...All my worries disappear.
It seems that Arcueid is just asleep.
<Page84>
"...Hah. Don't just go ahead and ask me to bring you to your room when it's convenient―――"
But in this case, it can't be helped.
Anyhow, it's not a good idea to stay in this hotel any longer.
<Page85>
...This was such a tragedy.
Even if no strange news is leaked outside, sooner or later someone will figure it out.
<Page86>
"......Guh."
The headache won't stop.
My body is also at its limit.
I put on my glasses so that I can at least relieve my headache.
<Page87>
"...Arcueid's room―――Ah, she means that place."
<Page88>
I've only been there once, but I definitely remember the place.
There's no point in staying here.
I retrieve my luggage from the royal suite, carry Arcueid and shamefully leave the vacant hotel.
<Page89>
The sky is getting brighter.
"...I see, so that's what happened."
<Page90>
The reason why the man left was so simple.
The sun had already fully risen up in the city.
Before I knew it, the night had already long turned into day.
<Page91>
...In any case, I should let Arcueid get some rest for now.
I decide not to catch a cab.
A suspicious pair like us are bound to be remembered.
<Page92>
I board a bus headed towards Souya Station to get as far away from the hotel as possible.
Fortunately, it's early in the morning so we did not attract any attention.
<Page93>
The emergency exit at the back of the building was still the same as the day before yesterday.
The residents and managers must not have noticed that the lock was 'broken'.
<Page94>
6:30 AM
I creep into the room of the self-proclaimed vampire woman the same way I did the day before, finally realizing that the long day had come to an end.
