I return to my room and change into my uniform.
It has just turned seven o'clock.
I take my bag and leave the room, marveling at how restored I feel after simply having a bath.
<Page2>
"Good morning, Shiki-san. You're up early this morning.#"//Kohaku talking to just Shiki, with contraction?
As I walk down the stairs, I see Kohaku-san coming out of the living room.
<Page3>
"You're looking somewhat refreshed.
Did you perhaps take a bath?"
"Yes, I took a bath just now. You're amazing, Kohaku-san. How did you notice that?"
<Page4>
"It's quite obvious. Shiki-san, your hair is still a bit damp.
After taking a bath, you look even cuter."
<Page5>
She gives me a carefree smile that made me avert my gaze for no reason.
...Being given a smile right now makes me feel a bit bad.
<Page6>
"Please wait a moment.
I am going to prepare breakfast now."
"Eh―――?"
...Breakfast.
In other words, I'm going to be eating something.
<Page7>
The most trivial words remind me of the color of blood.
This morning, I have even less of an appetite than usual.
<Page8>
"Let's see. Would you like a Western breakfast this morning?"
"...Ah, yeah. To be honest, I don't mind either way.
I see, breakfast. The bath was so nice that I forgot about it."
<Page9>
"Is that so? You didn't eat last night either, so I was consulting with Hisui-chan about whether the grumbling of your stomach woke you up."
<Page10>
"No, it's simply that I slept too much. I've always been a light eater even as a kid, so it's common for me to skip a meal or two."
<Page11>
"Ha hah. If you ask me, you have a nice, lean body. Are you a vegetarian by any chance?"
<Page12>
"I'm not fussy about that sort of thing... though now that you mention it, I think I only ate vegetables at the Arima house."
<Page13>
After leaving the hospital, the doctor told me to avoid any hard to digest foods, but I ended up avoiding meat regardless of that.
...It's probably because it reminds me of the death of a living creature.
<Page14>
"I see, so you don't have any specific preferences.
If that is the case, I can prepare your meal without any worries. Please wait for me in the living room while I get it ready."
<Page15>
Kohaku-san turns her back and heads to the living room, looking busy.
But I can't bring myself to swallow anything right now.
<Page16>
"...Oh, no need, Kohaku-san. I don't have much of an appetite today, so I'll just go to school. Tell Akiha I said so."
With that, I walk to the door.
But immediately afterward,# someone grabs my arm tightly.
<Page17>
"Shiki-san!"
...That was unexpected.
Kohaku-san seems angry.
<Page18>
"What are you talking about?
Shiki-san, didn't you look at the mirror this morning?!"
"...Well, I did look in the bathroom mirror...."
<Page19>
"You're lying. If you saw your face even once, you wouldn't say something like that!"
<Page20>
Looks like Kohaku-san is seriously angry.
...I remember when I saw my own face in the bathroom, it was beyond blue, a deathly pale color...
<Page21>
"But it's okay. I've always had a shortage of blood so I look paler than most people."
<Page22>
"No! You won't grow up without eating breakfast! If you don't have much of an appetite, I can make you a light meal, so please come to the dining room."
<Page23>
Kohaku-san grabs my arm and forcefully starts walking to the dining room.
...It can't be helped.
I'm seriously unenthusiastic about this, but I'll accept Kohaku-san's kind offer...
<Page24>
"Good morning, Nii-san.
How is your physical condition?"
<Page25>
Akiha's greeting sounds more reserved than usual.
She's lacking her usual bravado. She must be worried about my health, in her own way.
<Page26>
"Good morning. I'm feeling much better today."
I return the greeting and have a seat.
"Now then, I will prepare some easy-to-eat rice porridge for you.
Please wait a moment."
<Page27>
Kohaku-san moves quickly.
She goes into the hallway and heads to the kitchen at the end of the west wing.
There are three of us in the dining room - me, the uncharacteristically reserved Akiha, and Hisui, who is standing by the wall.
<Page28>
"........"
...This is kind of awkward.
"Nii-san,# regarding last night.
Is it true that you collapsed in the park?"
<Page29>
"Yeah. I can't quite remember it myself, but if Kohaku-san and Hisui say so, then it must be true, right?"
<Page30>
"Honestly, please do not talk about it as if it were someone else's problem.
You are physically weak, so if you feel like you are in any danger, please call the mansion. I will send someone to pick you up right away."
<Page31>
"...You know what? I'm not in elementary school, so there's no need for that. I can get home by myself no matter how bad I feel."
"Then you are still a child. After all, you did not come home by yourself yesterday."
<Page32>
"...Yesterday was an exception. That kind of thing is rare.
Besides, I'm just chronically anemic. That doesn't mean I'm weak. I don't need you to worry about me all the time.
I was just unfortunate to be in such a critical condition yesterday, that's all."
<Page33>
"Oh, critical condition? Do not say such nonsense!
You are talking about your own body, are you not!? You just returned to the mansion, what am I supposed to do if you were to die...?"
"――――――"
Akiha is seriously ticked off.
I'm surprised to see that kind of anger with no room for argument.
<Page34>
"You are too careless.
Please take a little more care of yourself."
<Page35>
"Well, I didn't do anything that unreasonable. I'm not doing any club activities and I'm following everything the doctor says. If you want me to take more care of myself, I guess I'll have to join a sanatorium or something."
<Page36>
"Yes, if it were possible, I would like you to do that.
We could also buy an isolated island somewhere and have you reflect on what you have done there."
<Page37>
Akiha sullenly averts her gaze and casually makes a scary remark.
What's scary is that Akiha wasn't joking about what she just said.
<Page38>
"―――Sigh.
Fine. Nothing happened this time, so I will drop the matter.
But there will not be a next time, Nii-san."
<Page39>
Having spoken her mind, it appears that Akiha is finished with her outburst.
And as for Hisui, she's watching our current exchange with a statue-like gaze.
<Page40>
"......"
...This silence is awkward.
It looks like we still have some time before we can eat, so I will―――
C:> Ask about Akiha.
C:> Have a word about Kohaku-san.
C:> Ask about the mansion.
