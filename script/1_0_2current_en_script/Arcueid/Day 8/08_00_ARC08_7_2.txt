I climb up the slope and reach the main gate of the mansion.
The time is around past 2:00 AM.
As expected, I am assaulted by an air of drowsiness.
<Page2>
"Huh? Crap, the gate is shut."
They closed the main gate.
After I had left at night, it should have stayed open by the time I came back...
<Page3>
"But I thought the auto-lock had already been turned off..."
It's possible that they may have changed the lock system.
<Page4>
In any case, I'm in trouble.
There's no need to climb over and enter inside. I don't want to set off the alarm, and I also want to avoid 'killing' the lock and opening the door.
There would definitely be a family meeting tomorrow in that case. I should only use my eyes as a last resort.
<Page5>
"Doesn't this mansion have a back gate or something...?"
<Page6>
"Hah...hah, ah―――"
I lean my back on the wall and take a breather.
I looked around the surroundings of the mansion, but the fatigue from the full day's work had finally made me dizzy.
<Page7>
...This is a sign of anemia. My breathing feels a little painful.
I want to immediately lie down, but unfortunately the conditions are not good enough for that.
<Page8>
I could not find anything close to a back door after walking around.
This tall wall continued to surround all over. I've come to realize how big the land of the Tohnos are after all this time.
<Page9>
I have no choice but to go around the national highway, go up the slope, and enter from the forest... but according to the map on my phone, the distance to get to the forest is around three kilometers.
<Page10>
"...I would have liked to save my energy..."
But before that, I would like to avoid walking through the dark forest alone.
There are still street lights on the road, but as soon as I enter that forest, it will become complete darkness.
Just the mere thought of walking at the dead of night sends chills down my spine.
<Page11>
"Hmm?"
What was that?
Right there between the two street lights. There is something standing in the darkness where the light doesn't reach―――
<Page12>
――――――Thump.
The feeling of accelerated blood flow in my body. Perhaps it is an illusion.
That thing is clearly a human being.
I just can't see it clearly. It's just the outline that looks different.
<Page13>
It's getting closer and closer.
Step. Step. Step.
I can hear the sound of dry footsteps.
It stares at me with a single, bare, bloodshot eye.
<Page14>
――――Thump.
I unleash the blade of my knife.
I put my hand on the temple arm of my glasses.
I feel a chill crawling on my back like a centipede.
In one more step, that shadow will enter into the range of despair.
Suddenly―――with a snap, the lights on the street lamps go out.
<Page15>
The moon is also hidden by the clouds.
The world suddenly turns dark.
<Page16>
"Hah!"
――――Thump...!
My heart jumps as if it was informing me of my death.
My dizziness clings to my ankles like mud.
I try to jump back, but it was too late for my body to respond to my thoughts.
<Page17>
The blade runs through the darkness.
I hear the sound of flesh being slashed above my heart.
<Page18>
"Ah―――Eh?"
―――I don't understand.
All I know is that there is a knife thrust deep in my chest.
<Page19>
For a brief moment, the moon peeks through the clouds, revealing the figure of the man.
<Page20>
An eerie figure painted in a black haze.
Ah―――I've seen this somewhere.
That was the last scene that I ever saw.
