<Page1>
I suppose it was due to the murders on the streets.
So far, I haven't passed anyone, and the park was completely empty.
<Page2>
There, a silhouette of a white woman stands alone.
<Page3>
"Shiki!"
"!?"
Nonetheless, as soon as she sees my face, Arcueid angrily yells at me.
<Page4>
"Wha――what? Did I get the time wrong, or something?"
"Yes! What time do you think it is?
It's ten minutes past the promised time!"
<Page5>
...10 minutes late... That's because I left the mansion just before ten o'clock, even if I ran as fast as I could, I wouldn't have been able to arrive on time.
Meanwhile, Arcueid seems to have arrived punctually.
<Page6>
"Aah, I'm sorry. I was hoping to make it here at ten, but it took me longer than I thought to sneak out.
If only you had a phone..."
<Page7>
I could've at least contacted her, but I felt like it would be insane to contact a vampire via email.
<Page8>
"No, it's nothing.
I'll be punctual next time. So just cut me some slack this time."
<Page9>
"―――Jeez. We're going to go kill a bunch of people, but you don't seem to be aware of it at all, do you?"
<Page10>
Arcueid was in such a bad mood that it appears like she's fuming.
"............"
Could it be that she was waiting for me before the appointed time?
<Page11>
".......Hey. Arcueid, how long have you been waiting here?"
"Me? I came here as soon as I woke up, so, uh――――"
<Page12>
"I'm pretty sure I got here at around seven."
"Seven o'clock, so you've been waiting for over three hours?"
No way, why would you come three hours before the appointed time in the first place?
<Page13>
"Yeah. Something's off with me."
Arcueid, as if she were bewildered, lets out such a soliloquy.
<Page14>
"......Well, it's my fault for being late, but you've got your own faults too.
I don't like it when people show up before the appointed time and then wait for me."
<Page15>
"Mmm. This and that are different matters. The fact that you're late hasn't changed."
<Page16>
"That's true, but...... .
But why did you wait for three hours? Even if you came here by mistake, you could've gone back to your room for the time being."
<Page17>
"That's something I don't get myself.
I just thought waiting for you Shiki, was fun, and before I knew it, it was ten o'clock."
"It was fun? How?"
<Page18>
"Come on. I told you that I don't get it either.
I don't know if it's because I was killed by you...... but it feels like something in me broke and hasn't healed up.
I think I'm going crazy, but I can't figure out what's wrong with my body and why."
<Page19>
"............"
I'm not sure how to respond to that.
After dismantling Arcueid into seventeen pieces, and then hearing that something's wrong with her body, all I can do now is to apologize.
<Page20>
"Aah, it's fine. #Time is running out, and we don't have time to waste just talking.
"Ah. I appreciate you saying that."
<Page21>
"But if you're late again, I'll have to pick you up directly from your house. Shiki would be the one who couldn't keep a promise, so you can't complain, do you understand?"
<Page22>
"No――― you can't do that! I'll keep my promise. Of course, I'll keep it.
But unforeseeable situations happen all the time, right? Being late is one of them!
Why, don't you ever make the mistake of showing up to my house again! Plus, Akiha still has a misunderstanding about me, and if I push her any further, she might seriously turn my room into a kennel!"
<Page23>
"Hmmm...... Akiha, you mean the sister who doesn't look like you at all?"
".......That's a bit uncalled for, but yeah."
<Page24>
"Is that so. Are you really that afraid of your sister, Shiki?"
"You know, what kind of little sister intimidates their―――"
I almost say, "brother," but then I swallow my words.
I'm not afraid of her, but somehow, I'm not very chummy with Akiha.
<Page25>
"I simply don't want my little sister to have to worry about other things.
......I've been troubling her for a long time now. I just want her to stay unaware of all this for as long as possible."
"I see. You're quite considerate of your little sister, aren't cha Shiki."
<Page26>
"Basically, I'm nice to everybody.
I've only recently made an exception."
"Haha, that's me huh."
<Page27>
"......,you don't get it do you, I was being sarcastic.
that wasn't a compliment, I was insulting you."
<Page28>
"Is that so? But that means I'm an exception to you, right? I can't say I mind that kind of thing."
Arcueid is still laughing.
And smiling carefreely like a child.
<Page29>
"............"
My body is strangely hot, it seems that my body temperature has risen.
I exaggeratedly averted my gaze because I felt that if I look at her any longer, I won't be able to keep my attitude towards her.
<Page30>
"Let's get down to business, Arcueid.
We're going to be searching for the vampire as we did yesterday, right?"
"Oh, yes, of course. You don't have to take off your glasses for tonight though, just follow me."
<Page31>
We stroll through the city submerged by night.
Arcueid has a specific destination in mind, but without knowing the details, it's looks like the two of us were just wandering around.
<Page32>
"Tonight I just need you to confirm them for me. Let's start with the noisy ones first."
Saying this, Arcueid turns to go to the downtown area in front of the station.
<Page33>
A nocturnal castle that never sleeps past ten o'clock.
Exposition of civilization with various sounds and lights.
Fashionable places that change in a matter of months.
The white vampires walks by, looking the same for centuries.
<Page34>
...... No, centuries might be an exaggeration.
I've heard that vampires are immortal and live a long life, so the word just sort of came to me.
<Page35>
"Shiki, look at that building. It's six storeys tall and narrow. Do you see any lines on the people going in?"
"......It's normal. No dead people in or out."
"No luck. Let's move on. Put on your glasses. We've got a long way to go, so take it easy."
<Page36>
As she had said during the day, Arcueid had identified several places where the dead could be cruising.
There were six of them.
The first two were wrong, but the third, a rental building, was right on the spot.
<Page37>
The security guards coming in and out of one of the vacant rooms, were a cluster of lines.
Arcueid, judging things by my expression, left me in the hallway, went into the room, and came out a minute later without a problem.
<Page38>
"I'm sorry, this place is also a bust. There were only low-grade ghouls. I hunted all over this area yesterday, so they were on full alert."
Disappointment was faintly visible in Arcueid's eyes, who shrugged her shoulders in despair.
<Page39>
"What's with that smirk? Are do you enjoy seeing me fail?"
"No, I'm not. I was just thinking that you, who's always so easygoing, can also get discouraged."
<Page40>
"Mmm. What do you mean? I'm just as likely to break or smash things as a human would."
I was hoping she'd say, "I suffer and grieve as much as anyone else," but I thought that would be asking too much of her, so I kept my mouth shut.
<Page41>
We sneak out of the rental building and went to our next destination.
It's almost midnight.
<Page42>
As expected, the number of pedestrians dwindled and the neon lights also diminished.
The taillights of cars drift by.
As we walk Arcueid aligns her footsteps with the light.
<Page43>
After the fifth fake out, we're heading for our final destination.
This place seems to be a residential area.
Arcueid doesn't say a word, but I could somehow sense that it was the main destination for tonight.
<Page44>
"...Though, I get that it's necessary, but it's still frustrating.
It's so old fashioned that we have to search on foot.」
"Exterminating vampires has always been a hassle. Finding a coffin somewhere in the city isn't easy."
<Page45>
" I see, then that's fine... I'm not saying I don't like it. It's just that I thought it would be tough for you too, Arcueid!"
"Hmm? It's not exactly hard on me, you know? It's a set task, and if you follow the steps, you can complete it smoothly."
<Page46>
"Right." I replied blankly.
When it comes to exterminating vampires, Arcueid is absolutely methodical. No matter how mundane the task, if it's a step that leads to the goal, she'll ensure that it's done with a cold and steady approach.
<Page47>
Just because she can jump 10 meters in the air doesn't mean that everything she does is insane.
<Page48>
......When I think about it, it was the same when I first met her.
She was looking for a vampire in the crowd, so as not to disturb human society. Even though she could've done the same thing as Vlov if she wanted to.
<Page49>
"......what's with the staring?
If you don't keep your eye's forward, you'll trip."
<Page50>
"......Yeah. This is a pretty strange, isn't it?
Hey. Are you okay with being with me, Shiki? Aren't you afraid of hunting vampires?"
<Page51>
"What?"
I couldn't help but raise my voice at the abrupt and rather sudden question.
Am I okay with being with Arcueid?
I don't even need to think about that.
<Page52>
"I don't mind. I don't really know if I'm with it or not.
We're cooperating out of mutual interests. I'm scared of vampires, but I'll put up with it for the sake of the city."
<Page53>
Hmmm, Arcueid seems satisfied.
That's where the conversation ends.
We walk in silence down the sidewalk, with no one passing us.
<Page54>
We had come a long way from the station. In the past two hours, there were almost no results, but strangely, I didn't feel exhausted.
Although we haven't come close to solving the problem, we've certainly prevented the situation from getting worse.
I guess that's what makes me feel fulfilled.
"But it's nice to not have to worry about it."
She opened up about her feelings, something she's never spoke up about before.
<Page55>
"Shiki?"
"I'm a total bastard at heart, you know. I'm a total jerk, so having a good person like you around makes me feel safe."
―――From the bottom of my heart, I can feel at ease.
<Page56>
My perception was broken.
My consciousness as Tohno Shiki had been destroyed.
I wasn't supposed to be here.
......I think my notions, which I've held for seven years, are going to fade in front of her.
<Page57>
"Hey, hey.
Does that mean I'm making it fun for you?"
"The opposite. You are one of scary vampires. The only thing that makes me feel better is that no matter how things turn out, they won't be any worse than they are now."
<Page58>
"Mmm. Which part of me is 'scary'?"
<Page59>
"There are many parts. There's the part where I killed you, and then you came back to life and started chasing me,# or the part where you can get away with a fever of 3000 degrees,# or the part where you used duct tape, #or the part where you ran all the way up to the top of a building, or the part where you wrecked the station.
......or the part where you did everything you could to prevent a freezing wave from Vlov.
<Page60>
"The part where you churned up the bedrock, the part when you painted people's bodies with something I don't recognize, and the part about where you came to the school during the day."
<Page61>
"Alright, that's enough, I understand your feelings very well!"
"Hmm? Are you sure? I still have a few more things to say."
<Page62>
"Okay, I understand.
I know I'm a vampire anyway!"
<Page63>
Arcueid speeds up and quickly moves ahead.
"Wait a minute!
I can't catch up with you if you start getting serious!"
<Page64>
I run after the white back.
The sixth destination was already within a stone's throw.
