<Page1>
It must have been due to the serial killing incidents.
I had not run into anyone on my way here, and there wasn't a single person at the park either.
<Page2>
Over there, stands a silhouette of a woman in white, all alone.
<Page3>
"Shiki!"
"Huh?!"
But for whatever reason, Arcueid shouts at me as soon as she sees my face.
<Page4>
"W-What? Did I get the time wrong by any chance?"
"That's right! Geez, what time did you think it was?
You came 10 minutes past the time that we promised!"
<Page5>
...10 minutes... Well even if I had left the mansion before 10 o'clock, I wouldn't have made it in time even if I ran at full speed.
On the other hand, it seems like Arcueid came here right on time.
<Page6>
"Fine, my bad. I was hoping to make it on time as well somehow, but it took me longer than I thought even after I had sneaked out.
If you had a cell phone, I would have―――"
<Page7>
Then I would have contacted her at the very least, but the thought of communicating with a vampire by mail sounded completely insane.
<Page8>
"No, never mind.
I'll be sure to not be late next time. So please let me off the hook this time around."
<Page9>
"―――Geez. We're going to go out and kill after this, but your head doesn't seem to be in this at all."
<Page10>
Arcueid throws out a tantrum, making sounds like 'Hmph' and so on.
"......"
Could it be that she's been waiting here much earlier than the promised time?
<Page11>
"...Hey Arucied, how long have you been waiting for?"
"Me? I came here as soon as I woke up, so――――"
<Page12>
"I guess I've been waiting here since 7 o'clock."
"7 o'clock? Then you've been waiting here for over three hours?"
I mean, what was she going to do for three hours before we meet?
<Page13>
"Yeah. I think I'm acting somewhat strange."
Arcueid lets out her inner monologue, perhaps because she was also surprised at herself.
<Page14>
"...Well, I was also wrong for coming late, but there's a problem with what you just said.
It troubles me if you go out of your way to wait far before our time like that."
<Page15>
"Mmph. But those two things are different. It doesn't change the fact that you were late."
<Page16>
"Well that's true, but...
I mean, why did you even wait for three hours? Even if you made a mistake, you could have just returned to your room."
<Page17>
"Well even I don't know the answer to that.
I was just enjoying myself, and I thought it would be okay even if I waited, and the next thing I knew, it had already become 10 o'clock."
"You were enjoying yourself? But why?"
<Page18>
"Who knows. I told you that I didn't know myself, didn't I?
...Maybe it was because you killed me. It feels like some part of my body got broken and never healed.
I think I'm going crazy, but I can't figure out what's wrong with my body at all and why."
<Page19>
"......"
It's hard to respond to her when she says it like that.
I dismantled Arcueid's body into 17 pieces, and if I was told that her body became strange as a result, I would have no other choice but to apologize sincerely.
<Page20>
"Well enough with that. #We don't have much time, so we can't afford to be idly chatting around."
"Yeah. It helps a lot when you say that."
<Page21>
"But if you happen to come late again, then I'll have to come visit you directly. You're the one that couldn't keep your promise, so there shouldn't be any objections, right?
<Page22>
"Wha―――You can't do that! I'll keep my promise. I'll have to in that case.
But unexpected situations can happen at any time right? Then wouldn't being late mean that something went terribly wrong?!
That's why I don't want you to come to our house ever again! Even if Akiha is still unaware, if you stir things up any further, my room could seriously turn into a dog house!"
<Page23>
"Hmm... When you say Akiha, you mean that little sister that doesn't resemble you at all?"
"...The way you said it is a bit extreme, but yeah."
<Page24>
"Is that so. Are you really that afraid of your younger sister?"
"Come on now. On what world would an older brother be afraid of―――"
I swallow my words before I could finish my sentence.
It's not that I'm particularly afraid of Akiha, but I do find her hard to deal with one way or another.
<Page25>
"It's just that I don't want to cause any unnecessary worry for my sister.
...I've been causing trouble for her ever since I was little. I want things to stay like this and not let her know about anything if possible."
"I see. You treat your little sister very well, don't you?"
<Page26>
"In general, I treat everyone very well.
It's just that one person has become an exception recently."
"Ahaha, you're talking about me!"
<Page27>
"...You really are a mystery. I was being sarcastic just now.
That wasn't a compliment, I was trying to insult you."
<Page28>
"Is that so? But you said that I was your exception, right? I don't necessarily hate that you know."
Arcueid gives me a smile once again.
It was a carefree smile like that of a child.
<Page29>
"......"
My body feels strangely hot. It seems that my body temperature is rising.
It feels like an air of maliciousness is going to spill out of her if I continue to look, so I exaggeratedly avert my gaze.
<Page30>
"Let's get down to business, Arcueid.
We're going to be looking for vampires just like yesterday, right?"
"Oh, yeah that's right. You don't have to take off your glasses tonight, so just follow me from behind."
<Page31>
We stroll through the night city.
Arcueid said that she's headed toward a specific destination, but because I don't know the details, it looks as if the two of us are aimlessly walking around the night city.
<Page32>
"This time I'll get you to see at a pinpointed location. Let's begin with the noisy one."
As she says that, Arcueid turns her feet toward the downtown area in front of the station.
<Page33>
The city does not sleep even past 10.
An array of various sounds and lights all line up to create an exhibit of civilization.
Through the trendy city that changes merely after a few months,
the white vampire whose form had never changed in centuries passes through.
<Page34>
...No, perhaps centuries is a bit of an exaggeration.
I only thought of that word after hearing that vampires lived long lives through their immortality.
<Page35>
"Shiki, look at that building over there. The narrow one that's six stories tall. Do you see the lines on the people going inside?"
"...It's normal. There aren't any dead going in or out."
"So it's a miss. Let's go to the next spot. Right, put on your glasses. The next one is quite far, so don't push yourself too hard."
<Page36>
Just as she said during the day, Arcueid has a good idea of the areas where the dead are patrolling.
In fact, there were six of them.
The first two areas were misses, but the third one that was a rental building was a hit.
<Page37>
The security guard coming in and out of one of the vacant tenant rooms was a cluster of lines of death.
Arcueid determined it by the look on my face alone, entered the room while leaving me in the corridor, and finished the job after a minute without a problem.
<Page38>
"I'm sorry, this place is also a miss. It was just a low ranking ghoul. We hunted all over this area yesterday, so they are on complete alert."
Although it was faint, I could sense a hint of disappointment from Arcueid as she shrugged her shoulders.
<Page39>
"What are you smiling about? Is it really that fun to watch me fail?"
"No, that's not it. I was just thinking that even someone as carefree as you can become so disappointed."
<Page40>
"Hmph. What do you mean by that? I can break and destroy things just like everyone else."
I would have preferred it if she said that she can 'feel sad and troubled just like everyone else' instead, but I decide to shut my mouth knowing that it would be a tall order for her.
<Page41>
We sneak out of the rental building and head toward our next destination.
The time is close to midnight.
<Page42>
As expected, the number of pedestrians decreased and the neon lights also diminished.
The tail lamps of the passing cars.
Arcueid takes her steps as if to match those lights.
<Page43>
After the fifth place becoming a miss, we head toward our final destination.
It appears to be in the residential district.
Arcueid doesn't say it, but I could somehow tell that this one was going to be the real deal.
<Page44>
"...However. I get it, but it's still irritating.
To think that we have no choice but to investigate by foot, it's far too old-fashioned."
"Slaying vampires have always been a pain even back then. We're searching the city for the location of the master's coffin, so of course it won't be easy."
<Page45>
"I see, in that case it's―――wait, I'm not saying I hate it or anything! I just thought that it must have been hard for you, that's all!"
"Hmm? But it doesn't really bother me at all. This is just the standard procedure, so it will simply come to an end if I follow the necessary steps."
<Page46>
I absentmindedly respond with a simple 'I see'.
Arcueid is completely rational when it comes to slaying vampires. No matter how plain the task is, if it takes her one step closer to her goal, she will cold-heartedly build upon it with certainty.
<Page47>
While it's true that she can jump as high as ten meters, it's not like she can jump over anything she wants to.
<Page48>
...Now that I think about it, it was like that when we first met as well.
This person blended with the crowd and searched for the vampire without throwing human society out of order. Even though she could have done the same things as Vlov if she wanted to.
<Page49>
"...What is it? Is there something wrong with my face?
You'll fall over if you don't look in front."
<Page50>
"...Yeah. This really is strange, isn't it?
Hey. Are you really okay with being with me? Aren't you afraid of slaying vampires?"
<Page51>
"Huh?"
I couldn't help but raise my voice in response to the sudden question. Or rather, to the fact that she asked me that now of all times.
She wants to know if I'm okay being with her?
I don't even need to think to come up with an answer.
<Page52>
"I guess. Regardless of whether it's okay or not, I just do it because I want to.
Our partnership is based on mutual interest after all. Of course I'm afraid of vampires, but I'll put up with it for the sake of this city."
<Page53>
'Hmm', mutters Arcueid as she understood.
From there, the conversation comes to an end.
In complete silence, we walk down the sidewalk with no one passing by.
<Page54>
We've come a long way from the station. The past two hours have been almost completely lacking in results, but strangely enough, it didn't feel like a waste.
The problem hasn't been resolved, but we definitely prevented the situation from becoming worse.
Perhaps it was due to feeling a sense of fulfilment, when suddenly...
"But it feels nice to not have to worry."
I speak out the thing that I never got to say from my heart.
<Page55>
"Shiki?"
"I mean the thing about being carefree... I'm, well, basically a good-for-nothing. But having someone as strong as you around is, well, how do I put this..."
―――Relieving from the bottom of my heart.
<Page56>
My vision is being destroyed.
My cognition is being corrupted.
I shouldn't even be here in the first place.
...That conclusion that I've known since seven years ago feels faded away when I'm in front of her.
<Page57>
"Hey Shiki.
Are you saying that you're having fun by being around me?"
"It's the opposite. I mean, we're talking about a terrifying vampire, right? It's a disaster in the making. The only good thing is that no matter how far I fall, things can't get any lower than this."
<Page58>
"Hmph. Which part of me is terrifying exactly?"
<Page59>
"A whole bunch of things. Like how you were intent on pursuing me after coming back from being killed, #or how you treat temperatures of 3000C like it's nothing, #or the duct tape, or how you ran all the way to the top of a building, #or how you made a mess at the front of the station..."
...Or how you used all your power to protect me against the cold waves of Vlov...
<Page60>
"Or how you flipped over an entire bedrock, or how you smeared some unknown substance on a person's body, or how you came to school during the day to see me."
<Page61>
"Right, I think that's enough. I've heard your thoughts loud and clear!"
"Hmm? Are you sure? I still have a few more to go."
<Page62>
"It's fine, I get the picture!
Hmph, well I am just a vampire after all!"
<Page63>
Arcueid picks up her speed and moves quickly ahead.
"S-Slow down!
I can't catch up to you if you go off like that!"
<Page64>
I half-heartedly run after the white back as well.
The sixth destination is already just a stone's throw away.
