I return to the mansion.
The sun hasn't set yet, and there's still time until Akiha returns.
<Page2>
"Akiha, I wonder if she's still mad from this morning..."
It's obvious that she would be upset about my behavior.
<Page3>
I haven't done anything satisfactorily ever since I returned to the mansion.
Everything will be fine if I just explain the situation... or so I thought, but there's no way she would believe me if I told her about vampires.
For now I'll bear the brunt and take on the role of a worthless older brother.

"Welcome back, Shiki-sama."
"Good evening Hisui. Thank you for coming all this way to greet me.
...Umm, has Akiha not returned yet?"
<Page5>
"Correct. Akiha will be arriving particularly late tonight, so I was ordered to have you eat dinner alone this time."
<Page6>
...I see.
It's a shame. I would have liked to talk to her about something at the very least.
I think I'll just go back to my own room and take a break.
<Page7>
"―――Shiki-sama."
"Hmm? What is it Hisui?"
Hisui takes a glance at the lobby and calls out to me once again.
<Page8>
"I know it is not my place to ask, but will you be going out tonight as well?"
<Page9>
Hisui gazes straight at me.
...It doesn't bother me that she can see I was going to slip out of the mansion.
After all, she already noticed that I wasn't inside my room every night.
In that case it's natural that she would suspect me of going out tonight as well.
<Page10>
The thing that concerns me is why she asked that question.
Even if she wanted to know what time I would return as a servant, letting Hisui know would be the same thing as letting Akiha know.
<Page11>
...This isn't a question that I should  treat lightly.
I'll―――
C:>...tell her the truth.
C:>...lie about it and deceive her.
