......Let's try to find out more.
 As long as I don't know what they want, there's nothing I can do about it.
<Page2>
"......I can at least listen to you if you want.
What can I do for you?"
<Page3>
"So, it's about the fire in front of the north station.
You know, the security company that was in charge of the scene on the day of the fire and the next day, that's your subsidiary, right? They've already left, but I'd like to talk to the person who was in charge that day. Do you have a contact number?"
"―――Is that so? I didn't know that."
thus, I don't have a number."
<Page4>
"What, you're the oldest son and you don't know? That's a big deal. Your sister has more power than you?"
"...What makes you say that? I know it's absurd, but are you implying that the fire was caused by the Tohno Group's negligence?"
<Page5>
"What? I have no such agenda. It was a spontaneous combustion, no matter how you look at it.
The problem is something else....... Well, I guess it's okay to ask the people in the house. I'm sure your family already knows."
<Page6>
"Yesterday, underneath the rubble of an underground cave-in, there was a rather unpleasant...... object that I didn't understand. The forensics team couldn't figure out what it was. That land belongs to Tohno, right?"
<Page7>
"According to the records, about 10 years ago, Makihisa Tohno bought it at a higher price than the market.
I'd like to know about that. Why did he buy a prime piece of land in front of the station and then turn it into a park?"
<Page8>
"I don't know. Makihisa is dead.
Is that all you want to talk about?"
"What? No, why don't you go talk to your sister? Didn't I tell you who I am and what I want?"
<Page9>
"Unfortunately, my sister is a busy woman.
Please leave her alone. If you want to talk to her, you can do so after you've gone through the proper procedures."
<Page10>
I turned on my heel and started walking down the hill.
I understand the matter.
......I can't grasp the situation, but I'm not going to let that shady detective see Akiha.
<Page11>
"Hey."
A high-toned voice stopped me.
If it was Detective Andou's, I was going to ignore it, but the boy's voice was filled with a strange, irresistible dignity.
<Page12>
"It's fine to be a righteous man, but you have to know your place. If you want to die like a human being, this is the place to do it."
"......What?"
I stopped and looked at the boy.
Did he just say "like a human being"......?
<Page13>
"............What are you trying to say, boy?"
"That's all I have to say, you idiot. If you don't listen to me now, you can go fuck yourself.
I'm going home, Andou. It's time to eat. Let's have cake, a cake. Get me a cake, a cake with cheese and honey!"
"Heh heh, as you wish...... I wonder why I came to Japan to babysit bonbon like you......"
<Page14>
The strange duo got into a parked car and drove off in the direction of the station.
<Page15>
Regardless of their appearance, people from the police were watching the mansion...... And the accident site in front of the station was on land owned by the Tohno family......?
"......No, it's a coincidence."
It's just a coincidence.
In the first place, that collapse was done by Arcueid without thinking, and the vampire incident has nothing to do with the land in front of the north exit station.
<Page16>
".................."
I swallowed down the bad feelings.
I regained my composure and started the long walk down the hill.
