In those days, the mansion was a big playground.
A forest like a deep sea.
A house like a tall castle.
We played around in the miniature garden
that took days to explore.
<Page2>
Every day was fun.
We didn't know anything about being an adult,
and the idea that the days and nights would always remain the same,
was something that we never questioned.
That was our frolicking, puppy-like childhood.
We got along so well that we became the bestest of playmates.
<Page3>
Every time we turned our heads, Akiha was there,
and whenever we waved our hand, she would hide out of embarrassment.
Yeah, that's the way it's always been.

In those days, the mansion was a big playground.
A forest like a deep sea.
A house like a tall castle.
We played around in that closed off world
that took days to explore.

I gently awaken from my sleep.
The morning light strips me off from my perpetual sleep.
From within that sleep,
I felt like I had seen some sort of nostalgic dream.
<Page6>
"Ah..."
The moment I wake up, a gruesome thing enters my field of vision.
<Page7>
A sharp headache that gouges onto the flesh and bones of my temple.
The morning is so vivid that it felt like the sun was falling onto the garden.
The powerful rays of the sun plasters all over the room.
<Page8>
"Ha... ah"
My glasses. I put strength into my arm to reach out for the glasses next to me, but I felt nothing but thin air.
I feel nothing on my limbs. My orders cannot be sent. It seems that my thoughts are the only things that can move in my entire body.
<Page9>
"――――――"
I can't even close my eyelids. All I could do was watch the time fly by.
<Page10>
The strong light diminishes.
I remember the feeling of my limbs.
I take a deep breath and finally put my glasses over this view.
<Page11>
"Ha―――――ah."
I breathe out and finally sit up from the bed.
<Page12>
It's no big deal.
These kinds of symptoms happened regularly back when I was in the hospital.
A temporary decline in eyesight due to exhaustion, then a paralyzing sensation on my limbs. On top of that, a decrease in appetite.
When I look at things for too long with my naked eyes, it's obvious that this would occur.
<Page13>
"But even so, this time is―――"
I have a feeling that I could see it clearly compared to previously.
It was difficult looking at the lines of the building. Usually they would appear thin, but this time I could see them with clarity which is very rare.
The aftershock that remained on my forehead from the headache was similar to that of a gunshot wound.
<Page14>
I remember Sensei saying something.
That it's possible my eyes could call upon something bad.
Arcueid told me not to use my eyes too much.
She said that it would be an act of destroying my brain―――an act of destroying Tohno Shiki himself.
<Page15>
"......"
This was the price I paid for getting involved with vampires as a human.
It's not that I put myself in danger every time I confront a vampire, it's that I've been putting myself in danger from the very beginning.
<Page16>
...There is no need to confirm it after all this time. More than anything, all I knew was that I wanted to cooperate with Arcueid.
<Page17>
"...That's right. Things like this are not that big of a deal."
<Page18>
Besides, looking away does not change the fact that there is a storm coming.
I'll erradicate every single vampire in this city.
If I want to protect Akiha and those close to me, I have no choice but to lend a hand to Arcueid.
<Page19>
"Okay."
I turn over my feelings and vigorously get up from the bed.
I'll put on a new change of clothes at once and send my thanks to Hisui for last night―――
<Page20>
"Huh――――?"
Now that I mention it, Hisui is nowhere to be found.
The time is past 7 in the morning.
Normally Hisui would be waiting here and calling out to wake me up at this time.
<Page21>
"...I wonder if Hisui stayed up late."
Despite this, there is still a school uniform neatly prepared on top of the table.
<Page22>
Perhaps she had some other business to attend to.
I'm curious, but in the end, it has nothing to do with me.
Besides I have no time in the morning, so I should quickly change into my uniform and go down to the first floor.
