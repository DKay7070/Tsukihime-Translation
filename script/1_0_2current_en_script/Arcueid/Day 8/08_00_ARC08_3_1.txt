It is said that in battle God favours the speedy.
The seeds of disaster should be removed as soon as possible.
I think I need to take her out of the school anyway, before the white lady gets into any serious trouble.
<Page2>
"Sensei, I feel anemic, so I'm going to the infirmary."
I raise my hand, get out of my seat, and head for the hallway without looking aside.
There is no time to ask for permission.
While everyone else seemed dumbfounded, I made my way out of the classroom as fast as I could.
<Page3>
"Oh, here you come.
You're so energetic, running with all your might like that."
<Page4>
"―――――"
......I can't keep my mouth shut.
The target had easily passed through the schoolyard and reached the courtyard.
Thank God. I'm really glad that there aren't any classrooms facing here.
<Page5>
"But, schools are so small and simple...
From the outside, I thought it would be way more solid and sturdy, and spread out like an anthill.
But isn't it just an ordinary building? Yeah, I like it because it resembles a puppy.―――#Kyaaa?!"
<Page6>
"―――you, come here."
Of course there was no time for a leisurely greetings.
I grabbed Arcueid's hand without question and started running.
<Page7>
We moved to the back of the gymnasium where would be no one.
Going out of the main gate would be too noticeable at this time. The best course of action would be to go out the back gate.
<Page8>
"Hey, what are you doing dragging me here for?
This place isn't any fun at all."
<Page9>
Arcueid was not happy, but schools are not particularly interesting buildings.
<Page10>
"What do I think I'am doing? That's my question!
Are you some kind of walking bomb?"
<Page11>
"What? I'm a walking bomb......?"
"Yes exactly. But that's still an understatement!
......You know. Why are you walking around in the daytime and coming to my school? You're weaker during the day, right? Your wounds hasn't healed yet, has it? Aren't vampires supposed to rest quietly until nightfall?"
<Page12>
"...... That's true, I suppose.
Since you are helping me, I thought I'd find some clues during the day.
I can't make you, Shiki, do something useless like you did yesterday..."
<Page13>
"That's exactly what I'm talking about. You can just wait until nightfall to do any work with me, since I said I would help.
.......Do you enjoy making me worry, you...?"
<Page14>
"―――Yeah, I'm sorry."
"It's fine, you know... Arcueid?"
<Page15>
"So sorry to worry you."
"――――――"
I felt my heart thumping a little louder than before.
<Page16>
Arcueid honestly apologized to me...... I didn't expect that, or rather, I was a bit baffled...... If she looks at me like that, I can't say anything―――
<Page17>
"But it's Shiki's fault too. I was watching you from downstairs and you didn't even notice me.
I didn't know how to get in, and I was about to run all the way up to where Shiki was."
"...wait. Did you mean to run up to my classroom on the third floor?'
<Page18>
"Yeah, since it's got nooks and crannies, it's not like I'm hurting for getting a footholds, making it kinda easy to jump up,over there"
"――――――"
I retract my previous statement.
She's still as insane as ever.
<Page19>
"...Thank God. I wouldn't have been able to get to class if you'd done that..."
I let out a sigh of relief.
I don't think many of the students noticed Arcueid, even after what happened in the schoolyard earlier.
<Page20>
"Anyway, I hope you're sorry.
......So. What do you want with my school? You said you were looking for clues."
<Page21>
"What? I'm just surveying the area, leaving no spots unturned as they say? There's no sign of the dead, so I have to find clues on foot."
"Mmm......thank you for your efforts. But if it was a nighttime, I'd have nothing to say about it."
<Page22>
"I'll be careful next time.
So, as I was walking around here, I smelled your scent, and I realized that this is where you go to school, and I just..."
<Page23>
"......walked into the schoolyard
I thought you was like a cat, but you're more like a dog, aren't you?"
<Page24>
"Excuse me, but I came here because I knew exactly what I was doing.
There's no sign of the dead here, compared to other places. We need to see what it's like, don't you think?"
<Page25>
"What? No, that is wrong, right? If there's no sign of the dead, it means it doesn't matter.
In fact, there are no incidents or accidents at the school, and at night, no one is there. If the dead were to attack humans, it would be in the city, not the school."
<Page26>
"......... Well, when you put it like that..."
"There's nothing unusual here. I don't know about vampires, but I have eyes that can see death, and if there's a dead person walking around, I'll know even if I wear glasses."
<Page27>
"All right.
If Shiki says so, then there might not be any abnormalities here."
"In fact, it's not that there might be nothing, it's that there is nothing."
Arcueid remained unconvinced.
<Page28>
"―――Oh no, it's lunchtime..."
No matter how unpopulated the area behind the gym usually is, some students will probably pass by during lunchtime.
<Page29>
"Anyway, if you stay here any longer, there will be a ruckus.
I'll keep my promise, so you'd better go home and get some rest. We may meet the enemy again this evening."
<Page30>
"......Hmm. You sound like you want to get rid of me, Shiki. Do you really need to be at school that much?"
<Page31>
"Not that it bothers me――― it's just that I have a lot of headaches!
If you like it, I'll show you around again when it's convenient, but for now, just get out of here."
"Here, here," I said, pushing Arcueid's back.
<Page32>
".................."
Arcueid said nothing in particular, but walked away with a look in her eyes that seemed to want to say something before the end.
<Page33>
...... Fu.
The tension has dissipated and I can finally catch my breath.
Now that it's lunchtime, I'll be able to nourish myself and get ready for the afternoon...... oh?
<Page34>
"......?"
I just heard a faint noise from behind the bicycle parking lot.
In the guise of a casual stroll, I walked to the shadows.
<Page35>
As it turned out, there was no one at the dead end. It must have been a stray cat or something.
