It is said that soldiers value great speed.
The seeds of disaster is something that should be plucked out as soon as possible.
Before that lady in white has a chance to begin any funny business, I should take her out of school at the very least.
<Page2>
"Sensei, I'm feeling anemic so I'm going to the infirmary."
With my hand still raised, I leave my seat and head toward the hallway without a second glance.
I don't have time to ask for permission.
While everyone remains dumbfounded, I take the opportunity to escape from the classroom in a quick stride.
<Page3>
"Ah, you're here.
You must be pretty healthy to come running at full speed like that."
<Page4>
"―――――"
...I'm shocked.
The target easily passed through the schoolyard and reached all the way to the court.
I'm glad. I'm so glad that there isn't a classroom facing the courtyard.
<Page5>
"But I have to say, this school is rather small and simple looking.
Looking at it from the outside, I thought it would be more hard and sturdy, something that spread out like an anthill, you know?
I guess this is just an ordinary building huh. Yeah, I like it because it reminds me of a puppy, but―――#Kya?!"
<Page6>
"―――You, come with me."
Of course I have no time for leisurely greetings.
I grab Arcueid's hand and begin to run, leaving no room for argument.
<Page7>
I move toward the back of the gymnasium where no one is around.
It would be too conspicuous if she went out through the main gate at this time. The best move here is to ask her to leave from the back gate.
<Page8>
"Hey, what are you trying to do, bringing me to a place like this?
This place is no fun at all."
<Page9>
It seems that Arucied is unsatisfied, but a school is not a particularly interesting building to begin with.
<Page10>
"What am I trying to do? That should be my line!
Are you some sort of walking time bomb?!"
<Page11>
"Eh? Me?... A walking time bomb?"
"Yeah that's right. And even that is a gross understatement!
...Listen. Why on Earth are you walking around during the day, not to mention my school of all things? You said that you're weak during the day, didn't you? Your wounds haven't healed right? Then shouldn't you quietly rest until nighttime like any other vampire?"
<Page12>
"Well you're right, but...
You are helping me out after all, so I thought I'd find some clues during the day.
I didn't want to waste your time again like yester―――"
<Page13>
"I'm saying that you don't need to go that far. I said that I would cooperate, and that means we would do everything together, so just wait until nighttime. I'm begging you.
...Sigh. Is it really that fun for you to make me worry?"
<Page14>
"―――Yeah, I'm sorry."
"No, as long as you understand then it's fi―――wait, Arcueid?"
<Page15>
"Like I said, I'm sorry for making you worry."
"――――――"
I feel my heart skip a beat with a remarkably higher thump.
<Page16>
To think that Arcueid would apologize so upfront like that... Perhaps it was because I never saw it coming, or that it felt somewhat anti-climactic... Or maybe I couldn't say anything because of the face that she's making―――
<Page17>
"But you were in the wrong as well. I've been watching you from below all this time, and yet you never even noticed me.
I didn't know where I was supposed to enter from, and I was almost about to run up to where you were."
"...Wait hold on. You mean you were going to run all the way to my classroom on the third floor?"
<Page18>
"Yeah, it looked rough on the outside and it didn't seem difficult to get a foothold, so it would have been easy to jump there."
"――――――"
I take back what I said.
This person lacks any semblance of common sense as usual.
<Page19>
"...Thank God. If you had done that, then the class would have been the last of my worries..."
I let out a sigh of relief.
Even when she was in the schoolyard earlier, I think there have only been a few students that noticed her.
<Page20>
"In any case, it's fine if you're sorry.
...And so, what brings you here all the way to my school? You said that you were searching for some clues."
<Page21>
"What do you mean? I was simply investigating. I guess you could call it road roller work? There's no sign of the dead, so I have to go out and find some clues."
"Hmm... well I appreciate the effort. I wouldn't have said anything if it had been nighttime."
<Page22>
"I'll be more careful next time.
And so, I was walking around this area when I noticed your scent, and that's when I suddenly remembered that this was the school that you went to, and then..."
<Page23>
"...You decided to walk inside the schoolyard.
I thought you were like a cat, but maybe you're more like a dog."
<Page24>
"Well that's rude. I only came here because I had some proof.
When I compared this place to the others, I found that there were no sign of the dead at all. Wouldn't it be bad if I didn't come to see it for myself?"
<Page25>
"No, it wouldn't be bad at all. If there's no sign of the dead here, then this place would be irrelevant.
In fact, there aren't any incidents or trouble happening in the school, and there's no one around once it becomes night. If the dead wanted to attack humans, they would go to the city and not here."
<Page26>
"...Well, I guess you do have a point."
"There's nothing strange around here. I don't know how to detect vampires, but I can at least see death with my eyes. If there were dead walking about, I would notice that something's off even with my glasses on."
<Page27>
"Fine, I get it.
If that's what you say, then there's probably nothing wrong here."
"It's not probably, there's definitely nothing wrong here."
An unconvinced look remains on Arcueid's face.
<Page28>
"―――Crap, it's already lunch break."
Even if the back of the gym remains unvisited, there will still be students passing by now that it's lunch.
<Page29>
"In any case, it will become a riot if you stay here any longer.
I promise I won't break our promise, so just go home and get some rest already. We might run into an enemy or something tonight after all."
<Page30>
"...Hmm. It sounds awfully like you're trying to get rid of me. Does it really bother you that much if I stay here?"
<Page31>
"It's not that it bothers me, but that my head hurts from a lot of things!
If you're really that curious, then I'll tell you all about it at a better time, so just leave already."
Hurriedly, I prompt Arcueid to leave by pushing her behind her back.
<Page32>
"......"
Without saying anything in particular, Arcueid takes her leave with eyes that seemed like she had something to say in the end.
<Page33>
...Phew.
With the tension broken, I finally catch my breath at last.
It's lunchtime now, so I should get some nutrients and prepare for the afternoon... Hmm?
<Page34>
"Huh?"
I felt like I heard a faint sound coming from bicycle parking area just now.
I approach the shadows, pretending that I was taking a casual stroll.
<Page35>
Sure enough, there was no one hiding at the dead end. It must have been a stray cat or something.
