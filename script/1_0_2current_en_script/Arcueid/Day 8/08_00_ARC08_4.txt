When I returned to the classroom after lunch, I found Arihiko there.
He hadn't been there in the morning, so it seemed he had simply come for lunch.
<Page2>
"Oh, Tohno, good mornin'."
"......"
Company president spending a lot of time at the office.
Had the whole school known about Arcueid, I'm certain I would've had a dispute with this guy.
I'm really glad that Arcueid went home quietly.
<Page3>
"Gee. What's with those chilly eyes?"
Can ya stop looking at me like the way you'd feel sorry for someone who just pulled an autograph coupon only for it to turn out to be for a CD that goes for 10 yen a piece?."
<Page4>
"Well, I'm sorry. I was in a bit of a situation and got tired, so I couldn't hide my true feelings. I'll be more careful next time."
"Seriously? But, what you should be hiding is what you just said, right?"
<Page5>
While saying this, instead of heading for his seat, Arihiko was cautiously looking towards the rear doorway of the classroom.
He seemed to be seriously planning to leave now after finishing his lunch.
<Page6>
"Well, have a nice day I'm off to save the world for a bit with a bunch of fellas over the net.#"
Arihiko hurriedly left the classroom.
<Page7>
And then, as he turns his back.
"Hey. You said before that the area in front of the north exit is dangerous, but where are the other dangerous places?"
For some reason, I asks him that question.
<Page8>
"What's that all of a sudden?# There aren't many spots that are as bad as the North Exit Department Store....... If I had to choose, I'd say that one. It's the abandoned hospital of Kushigata. It was a meeting place for the <biker gangs|Yankees> until two years ago, now no one can find them anymore."
<Page9>
"Kushigata is two stops away? But it's not surprising that an abandoned building would be rowdy, no one would normally be there."
<Page10>
"No, so... That's why, you know, nobody's around there anymore. One day, all the Yankees disappeared. Nearly thirty people have been reported missing, and they're still being reported as missing.
Well, this is a ghost story, not a violent incident like the one at the north exit. Nowadays, it's more like an inconvience for the government, where not even vagrant would settle down."

The homeroom meeting for deciding the program for next month's cultural festival was unexpectedly difficult.
Various opinions flew around, and as a result of the conflicting opinions of the boys and girls, the decision was postponed until next week.
<Page12>
After-school club activities are prohibited.
All students leave school promptly.
<Page13>
"―――― Well."
There was no point in dawdling in the classroom.
After this, let's go to...
C:>Abandoned hospital.
C:>The mansion.
