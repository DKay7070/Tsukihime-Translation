As I return to the classroom after lunchtime was over, I find Arihiko there.
Since he wasn't here this morning, he must have simply come to school to eat lunch.
<Page2>
"Yo Tohno, mornin' dude!"
"......"
Even the presence of the company president feels extreme.
If word of Arcueid had spread throughout the entire school, there would definitely have been a dispute between us.
I'm so glad that Arcueid decided to go home without making a sound.
<Page3>
"Geh. What's up with those cooled-down eyes of yours?
Could you stop looking at me with those eyes that say 'It's sad, but those CDs will sell at 10 yen each if we remove the autograph'?"
<Page4>
"Is that how it looks? My bad. I was tired from a minor dispute that I just had so I wasn't able to hide my true feelings. I'll be more careful next time."
"Seriously? But isn't what you've just said something you should be hiding?"
<Page5>
As Arihiko continues his ramblings, instead of going back to his seat, he restlessly turns his attention to the entrance at the back of the classroom.
It seems that he's seriously considering fleeing since lunchtime is already over.
<Page6>
"With that, great work today as usual. I'm gonna go and save the world with a bunch of buddies online.#"
Arihiko cheerfully exits the classroom.
<Page7>
But before he leaves,
"Hey. You said before that the north gate was dangerous, but are there any other places like that?"
I throw out that question haphazardly.
<Page8>
"Where did that come from all of a sudden? #There's hardly any other spot as bad as the northern department store... Well there is one if you ask me. It has to be the abandoned hospoital in Kushizuka right? It used to be where all those yankees gathered until two years ago, but nowadays it's become completely deserted."
<Page9>
"Kushizuka is the one two stations away, right? But it's natural, or rather obvious that an abandoned building is dangerous, so of course no one would use it."
<Page10>
"No, like I said, it 'became' deserted. Like those yankees, one day, out of the blue. Around thirty of them went missing, and even now the police are still searching for them.
Well that is pretty much a ghost story at this point, there isn't any violence like that of the north gate. Nowadays it's a place that looks like the result of a bad loan from the government where even vagrants won't settle down."

The homeroom meeting to decide on the program for the upcoming school festival next month was unexpectedly difficult.
Various opinions were flown past each other, and as a result of the opposing views between the men and women, the decision was postponed until next week.
<Page12>
The after school club activities have been prohibited.
The students all hurriedly make their way home.
<Page13>
"――――Now then."
There's no point in aimlessly wasting my time in the classroom.
After this, I should...
C:>...check out the abandoned hospital.
C:>Let's just go back to the mansion and prepare for the night.
