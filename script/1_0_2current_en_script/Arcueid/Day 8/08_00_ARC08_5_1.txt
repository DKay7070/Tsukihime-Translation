...I'll tell her the truth.
Even if I try to deceive her, I wouldn't be able to hide anything from Hisui and Kohaku-san who are in charge of maintaining the mansion.
In that case, I should at least properly inform her that I will be away from home tonight.
<Page2>
"...Yeah. To tell you the truth, I will be going out at night for the next few days.
But I swear I'm not doing anything bad. I know that Akiha will hate me for this, but I can't just stop what I'm doing half-way."
<Page3>
...That's right.
There is an unknown vampire on the loose claiming a countless number of victims, and the only one that can stop it is Arcueid.
As a human being who lives in this city, I cannot look away and pretend that everything's okay.
<Page4>
"I know this is bothersome, but it would really help if you could overlook this for a little while. I'll be back by midnight, so it would be great if you could just leave the front door open."
<Page5>
"I take it that you won't be giving us a reason?"
"...Yeah. Sorry Hisui. I want you to think of me as someone who is worthless and not ask any more questions."
<Page6>
"...No. You are my master.
No servant would scorn their own master and call them worthless."
<Page7>
Hisui speaks plainly with a blank expression.
With that, the conversation comes to an end.
I bow my head to Hisui and climb the stairs of the lobby.
<Page8>
"Please wait a moment.#"
...And so she says.
Hisui calls me to stop from behind with a voice calmer than ever before.
<Page9>
"...Well, I know this is impertinent of me to ask, but..."
After temporarily stopping mid-sentence, Hisui tightly clasps both hands and turns her sight toward me.
<Page10>
"If it is okay with you, I can hide the fact from Akiha-sama that you are going out at night."
"...You mean, you're going to get our stories straight...?"
<Page11>
"Yes. It is rare for Akiha-sama to come out of her room after dinner. Nee-san and I make our patrols before bedtime, so if we fail to report the information, then no one will know what happens inside your room."
<Page12>
"Well, that really helps. It helps... but is that really okay?
Aren't you two employed by Akiha?"
"I believe I stated before that my master is you."
<Page13>
...Even I don't remember whether she actually said that or not.
I asked her before to stop attaching '-sama' to my name, and now I'm here vehemently thanking her.
Hisui in her own way, listened to my shoddy excuse and then said that she would help me.
<Page14>
"Thank you Hisui. It would help out a lot if you did that."
"In that case, please use this card key from tonight onwards.
As ordered by Akiha-sama, I changed the password of the main gate to the mansion.
If you use this card key, you can unlock the gate even at night."
<Page15>
"Whoa, as one would expect, you work really quick..."
That was close... If I had gone out without knowing, I might have had to sleep in front of the gate when I came back until morning.
<Page16>
"That is all I have to say.
I will not stop you from going out at night, but I hope that you will take great care not to get hurt."
Hisui makes one final bow and takes her leave.
<Page17>
"―――――I did it."
A helping hand came unexpectedly to my rescue.
With this, it seems that I can sneak out of the mansion without making Akiha worry.
<Page18>
After eating dinner alone, I return to my room.
It is almost ten o'clock at night.
"Right―――let's go."
I tuck away my knife in my pocket and leave my room as quietly as possible.
