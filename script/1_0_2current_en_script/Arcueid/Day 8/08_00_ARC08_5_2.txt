I feel bad for Hisui, but there's no way I can tell her the truth.
What I do with Arcueid should be kept a secret,
and I shouldn't talk about the fact that I'm searching for a vampire that's threatening the city.
More than whether or not they would believe, I simply don't want to get my family involved.

"No, I don't plan to go out at night anymore.
After all, I only just got scoled by Akiha this morning."
"Understood. In that case, I will close the gate tonight as per usual."

From Hisui's position, she can't question me any further when I say that I won't be going out, so the conversation ends here.

After finishing my dinner, I lock myself inside my room.
The time is almost 10 o'clock at night.
I take extreme caution so as to not get spotted today of all days and make my way outside.
