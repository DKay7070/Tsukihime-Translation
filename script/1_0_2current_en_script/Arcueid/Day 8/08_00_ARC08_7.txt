I sit down on the bench and rest my body.
It took me about 30 minutes to regain the sensation in my limbs.
I hadn't realized it, but seeing the 'lines' of the deformed dead has taken a heavy toll on me.
<Page2>
Arcueid is standing in front of the bench.
She's been staring at me the whole time since she brought me here.
<Page3>
"...... You know what, Arcueid?
Now that the dizziness is gone, you can stop making that face that says 'it's my fault.'
You had to do that in the first place, otherwise the wound would have opened,"
<Page4>
"It's a figure of speech. I could have done anything with a variant like that. It's not about that. It's about your body. Do you remember what we talked about yesterday?"
" ' I'm just saying, don't use your eyes too much.' I know, I don't want to be a cripple either. I'll be careful next time."
<Page5>
"........ Haa. There's a limit to how thickheaded you can be? It's really hard to instill some sense of fear into you it appears.
Well, after all, you're used to the highest class of death, being so close to it. I guess that's why... Really, what am I going to do? Why don't I try this one time to really frighten you?"
<Page6>
".................."
Why is it that I am hit with what seems to be resentment here?
I'm looking for a clear explanation.
<Page7>
"I had my fill of top-notch scares when you were chasing me."
I know without being told that my eyes are dangerous.
After all, we've been together for seven years.
<Page8>
"I didn't get dizzy the other day, either.
It was just..."
...... Now that I think about it, it wasn't that I was seeing too many lines of death, it was just that I couldn't stop thinking about Arcueid.
<Page9>
"Just what?
"I'm just tired from all the walking. I know you don't mind that, but humans get tired after two hours of walking.
<Page10>
"That's all well and good, but...... don't you sometimes think about yourself too objectively?
Is it possible that your Mystic Eyes are making you hate yourself?"
<Page11>
"No, if I could hate myself, I wouldn't be bothered by my eyes.
And for the record, I've never looked at myself or anyone around me out of desperation."
<Page12>
"Oh, I see. I'm a little surprised.
You're right.
This is a matter of pride, or rather a matter of reliance.
Someone told me that even though I'm like this, it's because of some specific reason.
And until then, I don't want to give up on myself out of desperation. It's a small belief, but it's the kind of pride...... that has sustained me this far.
<Page13>
"Besides, my eyes aren't all that bad.
There are a lot of inconveniences when you have these eyes, but the fact that my appetite is diminished makes it easier for me. I've always been a small eater, so I think it's a good match."
<Page14>
"I don't know if there is any relation between the... reduced appetite caused by the Mystic Eyes and the digestive system you were born with.
"Oh, no, I'm sorry, that was a joke, or rather, I would be embarrassed if you took it seriously..."
<Page15>
"I'm serious. You said your eyes were acquired, but it could just be that they didn't show up until later."
<Page16>
"They just took a while to show up, is that it?"
"Yes. You may not have ancestors with eyes like yours, but you may have parents with similar eyes.
Even if there was no ancestor with an eye like yours, there might have been a parent with similar eyes.
Mages transfer their knowledge and magic circuits to their children, but different abilities such as yours are often passed on only through cross-breeding genes and appear as a second-generation inheritance.
<Page17>
"Genes from crossbreeding ...... You mean, from my father?"
"I'm not only talking about your father, I'm talking about your whole family.
It's unnatural to think that you are the only one in your family who is special.
If you have a gift, you should think that your entire family is special. Isn't that what your family is like?"
<Page18>
"――――――, huh?"
That's ridiculous, I laughed.
Genetic? This eye is in the Tohno family...... in Makihisa or Akiha?
I can assure you that it is not.
I'm the only one who's crazy in our house.
<Page19>
If I hadn't had that accident in the first place, I wouldn't have these eyes. This is not genetic, but an after-effect of the accident, of course.
<Page20>
"But I'll take your advice. Thank you, Arcueid."
"What? What's with all the politeness?
I think I just told you something you didn't want to hear. ......
<Page21>
"It wasn't a bad thing. You just said that out of concern for my health.
You didn't want me to push myself too hard on the prep work at school today, did you? You have a hard time during the day, too.
So, thank you. ...... I'm not in a position to thank you, though, as I've barely noticed you after all this.
<Page22>
"But what about you?
I hope that your stomach wound really did close?"
<Page23>
"What? It's closed up fine over there. Why...?"
"No, you didn't look good earlier. I mean, you didn't do anything to me, but you seemed to be in pain, or irritated..."
<Page24>
"uh?"
I feel a strange sensation in my chest.
It's not a pain, but more like an itch.
<Page25>
"Shiki?
"No... what's this?"
I didn't know what was going on, but I put my hand inside my shirt from the neck.
<Page26>
...Slippery.
Something.
There is something like paint, stuck to my chest.
<Page27>
"I don't know, ...... something, it's wet."
I pull my hand out of my shirt.
On the open palm of my hand.
The blood is sticky and bright red.
<Page28>
"Eh..."
Sting.
I felt a strange sensation again.
It took me an awfully long time to realize that it's from the old wound on my chest.
<Page29>
"Shiki, that's..."
"It's weird, it doesn't hurt, there's no open wound, but... there's blood coming out of my chest.
<Page30>
So red.
Clean, unclouded, eye-catching red water.
<Page31>
"...Oh, I was scratched by the claws of that guy just now.
It's not like it hurts, and it's only this tiny bit of blood coming out anyway, don't worry about it."
<Page32>
Arcueid is looking at my hand in dismay.
Or, more precisely.
She's staring at the red blood that's all over my hand.
<Page33>
"............ Arcueid?"
"........"
Arcueid doesn't answer.
It's just that her breathing is starting to get erratic.
Hah, Hah, as if she's trying to hold back the pain.
<Page34>
"Hey, Arcueid......!
What's the matter, is the wound still hurting..."
<Page35>
I grab Arcueid by the shoulders.
......and
She shook my hand away, as if to escape.
<Page36>
"...... Ar...... cueid?"
" Shi... Ki?"
A small voice, even hostile, uncertainly spoke my name.
<Page37>
"No, I don't think so.
......?
Arcueid awkwardly averted her gaze.
<Page38>
"What's wrong with you, you're acting weird.
Has your body not started to recover yet?"
<Page39>
"...... Yeah. I think I pushed myself a little too hard.
So I'm going home."
"Oh, yeah. ...... Well, you said that was it for tonight anyway.......
"...... Yeah. I'll wait for you here tomorrow."
<Page40>
There was no time to stop, no way to catch up.
Without even looking me in the eyes, Arcueid leapt toward the sky.
That's exactly what she did, like a rabbit hopping on the moon.
