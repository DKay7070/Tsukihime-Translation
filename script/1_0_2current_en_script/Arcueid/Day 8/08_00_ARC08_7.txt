I sit on the bench and rest my body.
The senses on my limbs come back after around 30 minutes.
I didn't realize it myself, but it must have been a massive strain to look at the 'lines' of that grotesque looking dead.
<Page2>
Arcueid is standing there in front of the bench.
After bringing me all the way here, she's been glaring at me this whole time as one would expect.
<Page3>
"...Listen, Arcueid.
My dizziness has already gone away, so could you stop giving me that look like I've done something wrong?
Besides, if I hadn't stepped in that time, you would have opened that wound again."
<Page4>
"That was just a figure of speech. I would have been fine against a mutation like that. But that aside, let's talk about your body. Do you remember what we talked about yesterday?"
"You mean the part about not using my eyes too much? I get it, I don't want to end up being a cripple either. I'll be careful next time."
<Page5>
"...Sigh. You're being way too laid-back. It's going to be difficult to instill a sense of urgency in you, isn't it?
Well, you are accustomed to being closest to the highest level of death, so it's not all that surprising. Seriously, I don't know what I'm going to do with you. Perhaps I should shove some fear down your throat at least once?"
<Page6>
"......"
What is she getting so upset about?
Can anyone explain this to me?
<Page7>
"If we're talking about fear, then I've already had my fair share the moment you chased me.
I already know that these eyes are dangerous without being told."
After all, I had to live with these for the past seven years.
<Page8>
"If it's about earlier, normally I wouldn't be feeling so dizzy.
It's just that..."
...Now that I think about it, it wasn't because I stared at the lines of death for too long, but because I couldn't stop thinking about Arcueid.
<Page9>
"It's just what?"
"It's just... that I was exhausted from walking too much. It might be fine for you, but it's tiring for us humans, especially for two hours."
<Page10>
"In that case it's fine, but... aren't you a bit too hard on yourself sometimes?
Like hating yourself because of your Mystic Eyes for example?"
<Page11>
"No, if I did hate myself, it wouldn't be because of these eyes.
Just so you know, I have never been in despair, whether it's about me or the things around me."
<Page12>
"―――Is that so? That was a bit unexpected."
Perhaps she's right.
This is a matter of pride, or rather, a matter of dependence.
There is a person who told me that even a person like me has a purpose.
So until that time comes, I don't want to give myself into that despair. It's a small belief, but that pride is what carried me all the way to this point... or so I believe.
<Page13>
"And besides, it's not like everything about these eyes are that bad.
There are a lot of things that are inconvenient when they're exposed, but having a lower appetite is a relief because it saves time. I've always been a light eater so I think it works out well."
<Page14>
"...I don't see the link between the loss in appetite from the Mystic Eyes and the natural digestive system that you were born with."
"Ah, well, sorry, that was a joke, or rather it's embarassing to talk about this seriously..."
<Page15>
"I'm being serious here. You said that your eyes were acquired recently, but it's possible that they just didn't show up until later."
<Page16>
"...They didn't show up... until later?"
"Yeah. Supernatural abilities may be mutations, but they still require a foundation to be born."
Even if there are no Ancestors that possess eyes like yours, you could still have descendants that possess eyes that are similar.
Although mages transfer their knowledge and circuits to their children, there are many cases of atavism where abilities like yours are transferred through the passing of genes alone."
<Page17>
"Passing of genes... in other words, from my father?"
"Rather than that, it's more like your entire family.
It would be strange to think that you were the only special case within that entire family lineage.
If you have a special ability―――then it would be more appropriate to think that your entire family is special. Isn't that what all the people are like in your family?"
<Page18>
"――――――Ha."
That's ridiculous, I laughed.
Is she saying that this is all genetic? That the members of the Tohno family... that Makihisa and Akiha have these eyes?
I can say for a fact that isn't the case.
The only strange one in my family is me.
<Page19>
Besides, these eyes wouldn't have turned out this way if it wasn't for the accident. This was not hereditary, but a prolonged symptom as a result of the accident.
<Page20>
"But I'll take your words at heart. Thank you Arcueid."
"Hm? W-Why are you being so polite all of a sudden?
I thought this sort of talk would be unpleasant for you..."
<Page21>
"It's not unpleasant at all. Besides, everything you said was out of concern for my health.
Even when you did some prior investigation at the school today, you did that because you didn't want me to push myself, right? Even though you have a hard time during the day.
That's why... I wanted to thank you. Although I'm in no position to thank you after taking this long to realize that."
<Page22>
"But now I want to know how do you feel?
Is that wound on your stomach really healed like you said?"
<Page23>
"Hm? I'm pretty sure I have that covered... but why do you ask?"
"Well earlier, you didn't look too good. You didn't take any damage, and yet you looked like you were in pain, or maybe you looked irritated―――"
<Page24>
"―――Kh?"
Just now, I felt a strange throbbing sensation in my chest.
It wasn't painful, but if I had to describe it, it would be something closer to an itch.
<Page25>
"Shiki?"
"Wait―――what's happening?"
Without knowing why, I put my hand inside my shirt down from my neck.
<Page26>
―――Squish.
There's something...
sticking to my chest like paint.
<Page27>
"What's this... it feels wet."
I pull my hand away from my shirt.
Inside the palm of my hand...
is a splatter of bright red blood.
<Page28>
"Eh―――――"
Zap.
Yet another odd sensation.
Even though I understood that it came from the old wound in my chest, it took me an awfully long time to realize that.
<Page29>
"Shiki, that's――――"
"That's odd. It doesn't hurt and my wound isn't open―――but somehow there's blood coming out."
<Page30>
How awfully red.
A water so beautiful, so pure, so eye-catchingly red.
<Page31>
"...Ah, maybe it's because I got grazed by that guy's claws from earlier?
It's not like I'm pain, and it doesn't look like there's any more blood, so there's no need to worry―――"
<Page32>
Arcueid continues to stare at my hand in dismay.
No, more like...
she's staring intently at the red blood clinging to my hand.
<Page33>
"...Arcueid?"
"――――――――"
Arcueid does not respond.
All I can see is that her breathing is erratic.
It's so disarrayed that it looks like she's trying to hold back the pain.
<Page34>
"Hey, Arcueid...!
What's wrong? Don't tell me that it's the wound―――"
<Page35>
I grab onto Arcueid's shoulder.
――――And then...
she brushes my hand away like she was trying to escape.
<Page36>
"Ar...cueid?"
"Shi―――――ki?"
For a short moment. With a voice that might even contain hostility, Arcueid calls out my name with uncertainty.
<Page37>
"No―――I didn't think about that at all."
......?
Arcueid looks away awkwardly.
<Page38>
"What's the matter? You're acting strange.
Has your... body still not recovered yet?"
<Page39>
"...Yeah. I might have pushed myself a bit too much.
That's why I'm going home."
"R-Right. Well, you did say that we were finished tonight after all..."
"...Yeah. I'll see you here again tomorrow."
<Page40>
If I have no time to stop her, then there's no way I would be able to chase after her.
Without looking me in the eye, Arcueid leaps toward the clear, vast sky.
Like a rabbit bouncing on the moon.
