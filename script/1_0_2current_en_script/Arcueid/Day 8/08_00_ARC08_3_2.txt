Suddenly, I feel calm.
I am a human being who can separate the things I can do and the things I cannot do with absolute precision.
<Page2>
What can one small man do against the raging waves known as destiny?
That's right. <I have no other choice but to pray.|Whatever happens, happens.>
<Page3>
"That reminds me, I'm a big fan when it comes to Modern Society."
I'll focus on the class and avoid looking to my side.
After all, we're right at the part where we passionately discuss global environmental issues of the 21st century.
<Page4>
"......"
I see, the Earth's resources are too much for the current mankind to deplete, but that and the changes in the Earth's surface due to environmental destruction are two separate issues. Humanity cannot destroy the planet no matter how reckless we become. However, the atmosphere and ecosystem changed due to our own negligence, causing the hurdle of our existence to become even higher. #Even if I leave my own room in a mess, it only means that I won't be able to live in it, and the house itself won't change, so the only one that is punished is me, who is kicked out of the room without a place to stay. Yup, that would only be natural.
<Page5>
By the way...
I've been concentrating on the class with all my might, but what's with these chills that's been building up since a while ago?
<Page6>
"Yup, this is it!
All the rooms looked the same so I was in a bit of a pickle!"
<Page7>
Laughing out loud out of sheer embarrassment, the trespasser walks briskly up to the podium... I'm not sure what she's so embarrassed about...
<Page8>
"W-What do you think you're doing? We're in the middle of class-"
Mr. Mamiya of the class of Modern Society scolds the trespasser even through his bewilderment. As one would expect. He isn't just the oldest teacher in our school. He is a role model for teachers all around.
However...
<Page9>
"We've been waiting for you. Right, here are the materials for today."
Mr. Mamiya easily hands the textbook over to the trespasser and simply leaves the classroom.
<Page10>
The class is in a state of chaos. Even as they are surprised by the sudden turn of events, the students operate their mobile phones with full speed and begin chatting through the internet that they rely on.
<Page11>
'Sorry, can anyone explain what's going on?'
'I know Mamiya just left, but is this really okay?'
'Does anyone know her? She smells pretty nice.'
'I demand an expert's opinion on this matter.'
'Shit she's so close! She's so pretty!'
'This school's getting too wild with her and Noel-sensei.'
'I thank the Lord for bringing her to the front of the blackboard.'
'For her to come during the middle of class, this must be the work of a terrorist.'
<Page12>
"You guys..."
You can't possibly be that impervious to danger.
<Page13>
"Nice to meet you all. Name's Arubi, and I will be your special guest lecturer!
I appreciate all the warm welcome for me today!"
No, maybe this isn't such a dangerous situation after all.
<Page14>
I shift my chair back by one body length,
pretend that I'm slipping off the chair and onto the floor,
and make my way toward the back entrance of the classroom.
<Page15>
Everyone else is concentrated on the special guest Arubi standing on the podium, so no one has noticed my attempt to escape.
There's no doubt about it. She's abusing her Mystic Eyes or something, whether it was with Mr. Mamiya or with this current situation.
<Page16>
"Umm, it's okay if I just write a bunch of things on the blackboard right?
Modern Society...? Ah, so this is the study of societies! Well since I'm already here, allow me to begin the special course on vampire―――"
<Page17>
Wait hold on, I really want to listen to this.
No, but this is what the enemy wants.
There's still 10 minutes left until lunch break.
"Ah! Shiki isn't here!
He ran off! That little...!"
I try my best to remain calm and run toward the place that I need to go.
<Page18>
I move to the back of the gymnasium where noone is around.
If we talk here, then we won't grab the attention of the other students.
Now all I have to do is wait...
<Page19>
"Hey!
Why are you running when I came all this way to see you?!//youtube/W6oQUDFV2C0
Wouldn't it be better to show some guts for once and take in whatever flies at you?!"
<Page20>
As you can see, I can get out of my predicament if I lure the destroyer with my bait and make her chase me.
<Page21>
"No. If I sense any danger, then I run."
Of course there are exceptions to that rule, but let's not say that out loud.
<Page22>
"But besides that!
Arcueid-sensei, I'm the one who should be upset here.
Didn't you say that you wouldn't get yourself involved with human society?
You did say that you would try not to stand out, didn't you?"
<Page23>
"And yet what the hell was that about?
To think that you would appear in public so brazenly, are you even taking this whole vampire extermination thing seriously?!"
<Page24>
"What the hell, of course I'm taking this seriously! Shiki you dummy!
Besides, I even made sure to put on a disguise! I didn't stand out at aaaall!"
<Page25>
"A disguise?... Don't tell me... is it those glasses?"
Could it be that she's a terrifying monster indeed?
<Page26>
"Yup, that's right!
I was wondering if I understood your feelings, so yesterday I did some homework!
When it comes to school, it's all about teachers, and when it comes to teachers, it's all about glasses right?
I haven't got a slightest clue on why you people wear them, but it looks good right?"
<Page27>
"―――Mmph, Gh..."
In a voice that seems to have sprung up from the bottom of her heart, Arubi-sensei displays her glasses to me.
<Page28>
...Shit. What's up with this vampire... That's not fair... I was completely ready to scold her just a moment ago, but when she shows me a face like that, all motive just disappears...
<Page29>
"Ah geez, fine, I get it!
If there's something you want to talk about then I'll listen, but no more Arubi-sensei, and no more of those glasses!"
<Page30>
"―――Ah."
I confiscate the deadly goods from Arcueid.
If she had the added bonus of those glasses, then I wouldn't even be able to compete with her.
That is a forbidden move and must never be allowed to be used again.
<Page31>
"...I went through all that trouble to create that, and now you took it away."
"Don't say it like I'm the bad guy here. It's normal to confiscate dangerous goods in school."
"...Did it not look good at all...?"
<Page32>
"――――――"
I couldn't help but gasp at the weak side that was uncharacteristic of Arcueid.
<Page33>
...I'm feeling more captivated by her than usual.
I don't know if she's not feeling well because it's the middle of the day, or if I'm becoming interested from seeing a new side of her, but right now I need to figure out what to do with Arcueid―――
