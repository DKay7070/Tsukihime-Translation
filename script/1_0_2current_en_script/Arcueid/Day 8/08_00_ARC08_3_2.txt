Suddenly, I became calm.
I am a person who can separate what I can and cannot do.
<Page2>
When faced with the stormy waves of fate, what can a tiny human do alone?
Yes, there is nothing to do but pray, and let things happen as they will.
<Page3>
"Come to think of it, I've always been a big fan of Social Studies."
Let's concentrate on the class without looking aside.
I'm going to concentrate on the class, and I'm going to learn about the global environmental issues that have arisen since the beginning of the 2000s.
<Page4>
".................."
I see, earth's current resources are too abundant for the present day human race to use up, but that and the changes in the earth's surface due to environmental destruction are two different issues. Human beings can't destroy this planet no matter how much they try. However, because of our own mischief, the temperature and ecosystem will change, and the hurdles for human survival will increase. #If I leave my room in a mess, I won't be able to stay in there, but the house itself won't change. The only one to suffer consequences is me, as I can't use my room and obviously there's nowhere else for me to stay.
<Page5>
By the way.
I'm trying my best to concentrate on the class, but what's with the chill that's been building up since a while ago?
<Page6>
"Oh yeah, this is the place!
I had a hard time going through all the rooms that looked the same!"
<Page7>
Ahaha. I... don't know what sort of embarrassed... smile I'm making, but the suspicious person is moving quickly to the podium.
<Page8>
"W―What's the matter with you? I'm in class."
The modern society teacher, Mamiya, was puzzled, but scolded the suspicious person. That's what I'm talking about. He's not just the oldest teacher in our school. He's also an excellent teacher.
However.
<Page9>
"I've been waiting for you. Here are the materials for today."
Mamiya casually hands the textbook over to the suspicious person and leaves the classroom.
<Page10>
A buzzing classroom. The <students|classmates>, surprised by the suddenness of the situation, switch on their mobile phones at record pace and start chatting with each other.
<Page11>
"Sorry, can someone explain this to me?"
"Mamiya left, but is that okay?"
"I don't know. Do you know her? She looks good."
"I seek opinions from experts."
"Oh my God, she's so close, she's so beautiful!"
"This school is going through too many changes, with the arrival of Noel-sensei."
"I thank God that I'm in front of the blackboard."
"Only people who cause a ruckus come to class."
<Page12>
"Everyone......"
How little awareness do they have of the dangers we're in?
<Page13>
"Nice to meet you, I'm Alumi, your special instructor!
Thank you all for coming for me today!"
No, this isn't a matter of danger awareness, right?
<Page14>
I slid back the chair back by one body length.
I slide off the chair so I fall to the floor.
I continue moving toward the exit at the back of the classroom.
<Page15>
Everyone in the classroom was too preoccupied with the special teacher, Alumi, standing on the podium to notice my escape.
No doubt about it. The teacher Mamiya and this situation, the Mystic Eyes are being misused.
<Page16>
"'Well, I should just write stuff on the blackboard, right?
Modern Society......? Oh, social studies! So let's just start a special vampire lecture..."
<Page17>
Oh, wait, I want to learn about this.
No, but that's exactly what the enemy wants.
Ten minutes left until lunch break.
"Aaah! Shiki's gone!
You ran away, you bastard―――!"
I tried to remain calm and ran to the place where I needed to go.
<Page18>
I move to the back of the gym where there is no one around.
Here, I won't catch the attention of other students.
Now......
<Page19>
"Hey!
What do you think you're doing running away when I've come all this way to see you!
Don't you think you should have the guts to take any situation head on!?"
<Page20>
As you can see, if the vandal has been caught by the bait and chase after you, you will have escaped your predicament.
<Page21>
"No. If I sense danger, I run."
It depends on the type of situation, but I keep my mouth shut there.
<Page22>
"That's not the point!
Arcueid-sensei, I'm the one who should be angry.
You said you don't want to be a part of human society, right?
Didn't you say you would avoid being conspicuous?"
<Page23>
"But what the hell was that?
I'm not sure if you're serious about killing vampires anymore."
<Page24>
"What? Of course I'm serious, you idiot!
Besides, I was wearing a proper disguise! I didn't stand out!"
<Page25>
"Disguise...... no way...... are those glasses ......?"
Are you a truly terrifying monster?
<Page26>
"Yes, that's right!
I spent yesterday studying to see if I could understand Shiki's feelings!
School is for teachers, and teachers wear glasses, don't they?
I don't get why you wear them at all, but do they look good on me?"
<Page27>
"―――m, guh ......"
In a voice that bounces from the bottom of my heart, Alumi-sensei shows me her glasses.
<Page28>
......Damn, what a vampire...... It's not fair...... I was ready to scold her just a moment ago, but when she looks at me like that, I lose steam...
<Page29>
"aahhh dammit, I understand, I understand!
If you want to talk to me, I'll listen to you, but no more Alumi-sensei, and I'll confiscate your glasses!"
<Page30>
"Oh."
I seize the dangerous product from Arcueid.
If they even put on the glasses attribute, I can't compete with them anymore.
This is a forbidden move and must be banned.
<Page31>
"...... I made it, but Shiki took it away."
"Don't make it sound like it's my fault. At school, they confiscate hazardous materials."
"......didn't I look pretty......?"
<Page32>
"――――――"
I gasped at the vulnerability that was so out of character for Arcueid.
<Page33>
......I'm even more transfixed than usual.
It's daytime, so she's not so energetic, I don't know if I'm bothered by that kind of Arcueid because it's new, or if I'm bothered by the fact that, in the first place, no matter what she does, in the end――
