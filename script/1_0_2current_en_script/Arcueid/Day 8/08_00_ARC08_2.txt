"Before you eat, we have something to talk about.
Please take a seat on the sofa."
<Page2>
They were overwhelming words that I could not argue against.
Words such as 'you reap what you sow' and 'a foolish brother ought to die' revolve inside my head.
...I guess I have no choice but to accept it and take my stand.
<Page3>
"...Fine, please make it as brief as possible."
I sit on the sofa across from Akiha.
<Page4>
Kohaku-san prepares a teacup without a moment's delay.
It gives me a small amount of courage as if she was silently telling me 'Good luck Shiki!'.
<Page5>
That's right. She may be the family head, but she is still my sister.
Surely it won't turn out to be such a one-sided match.
I take a sip of the black tea and make eye contact with Akiha.
<Page6>
"So what did you want to talk about?"
"Did you have intercourse with the woman from last night?"
"―――Gboh!"
<Page7>
That was bad. I almost choked there.
That Akiha went too far. She didn't even wait before throwing a straight at the first pitch.
I could have choked to death from the black tea.
<Page8>
"Nii-san. Are you listening to me?"
"I'm listening. I can hear you loud and clear."
<Page9>
"If that's the case, then answer me.
Tell me about the woman from last night, accurately, without deceit, and in as much detail as you can without making me upset."
<Page10>
"If those are your conditions, then there is nothing I can say."
"Even though I warned you not to make me upset?"
So those were her warnings and not her conditions...!
<Page11>
"...Man, this is really starting to feel like an impossible task..."
<Page12>
"What's that? I couldn't hear you because you were quiet. Please speak louder so I can hear you.
Exactly what kind of person is that woman to you, Nii-san?"
<Page13>
"Well if you ask me, we're like mutual partners, or maybe something like friends? Or rather―――"
<Page14>
"Hmm. You two must be very close to be able to go out at night like that.
Yes, I have no opinion on who you choose to have a future relationship with, but isn't it true that you're still a student?"
<Page15>
"For the eldest son of the Tohno family to, well, go out on a rendezvous with an unknown woman every night. Shouldn't you refrain from doing such indecent acts like that?"
<Page16>
...I see. So that's how our relationship looks like in her eyes.
<Page17>
"Hold on Akiha. First things first, we don't have that kind of relationship.
All I'm doing is helping her find something, and once that's over, I have no other reason to see her again."
<Page18>
"...That's odd, considering how awfully close you looked, but I guess you would say that it was just my imagination.
Are you telling me that this is simply a temporary, give-and-take relationship?"
<Page19>
Akiha's gaze is cold.
If I nod out of confirmation, this conversation could be settled peacefully.
...But I feel strangely reluctant in affirming that statement.
Although we both have something to gain by working together, I find it hard to say that is all there is to it.
<Page20>
"Well that is... we're not exactly close, but it's not like I'm helping her purely out of give-and-take either."
"Of course. After all, I've never seen you in a panic like that before. To see Nii-san who would never take anything seriously to reveal his emotions like that, naturally I would question what on Earth would have brought that on."
<Page21>
"I didn't panic that hard, and I'm not that cold either. I was just surprised because I didn't expect her to visit our house."
"Really now? Even though that woman remained totally calm as she waited for you for that long?"
<Page22>
Akiha gives me a sidelong glance like she had something to say.
It seems that she thoroughly believes that Arcueid and I are going out.
<Page23>
"Hey Akiha. Could you stop with the misunderstandings?
Besides, the only reason we know each other was because―――"
<Page24>
I stop myself from saying that it was because we killed him.
...It's not like she would believe me even if I did tell her the truth. And besides, there's no way I could let her know about that sort of thing.
That being said, I can't think of any other better explanation, so I had no choice but to evade the question and mumble the same words as last night.
<Page25>
"If you cannot answer the question, then perhaps I should change it.
You've been constantly referring to her as 'that woman' for a while now, but what exactly is her name?"
"Her name is... Arcueid."
<Page26>
"Is that so? Then that means you two didn't know each other from school. There are no exchange students in your school after all."
<Page27>
"*agh*"
It's just as Akiha says, there isn't a single exchange student from abroad in our school... But even so, why does Akiha know about that?
<Page28>
"And so, how exactly did you two come to know each other?"
"W-We met each other in the city. By accident."
<Page29>
"By accident, you say. So then Arcueid was the one that called out to you, correct?"
"Ah―――well, actually it was me who called out to her..."
In reality, it was me killing her then becoming chased afterwards rather than me calling her out. In any case, I was the one who triggered the situation.
<Page30>
"Why did you call out to her?
I thought there was nothing between you and Arcueid-san. Or are you saying that wasn't your intention at first?"
<Page31>
Akiha's question was truly precise.
She's approaching the vital matter one step at a time.
<Page32>
This is like a frog being glared at by a snake, where I'll eventually be pushed to a point where I can't deceive her anymore.
...It's depressing but it is what it is.
At this point, I should end this conversation even if I have to use force.
<Page33>
"Oh come on, I'm telling you there's nothing between us!
And besides, what I do with my life has absolutely nothing to do with you.
In any case, I'm just the eldest son for show, so I shouldn't cause any trouble to the Tohno family even if I go out with someone."
<Page34>
I know it's unfair to bring up the fact that I was disowned at one point, but this was the only way I could get her to withdraw from the matter.
After raising her brow, Akiha stands up without making a sound.
<Page35>
"Hmm?"
...That's odd.
I thought for sure that she would ruthlessly strike back at me, but on the contrary, Akiha looks away with an unpleasant expression.
<Page36>
"Even I didn't want to have a conversation like this.
I just... have a bad feeling about that person. If it was anyone else then I would have simply dropped the matter. However, when I see you relax around that person, I can't help but feel like I'm being foolish."
<Page37>
...I don't get it.
Why does she look so much in pain, biting her lips as she says those words?
<Page38>
"What's wrong Akiha? You're acting a bit strange."
"That's enough. If that's what you really want to do, then do whatever you please...!"
<Page39>
In an unusual, violent stride, Akiha takes her leave from the living room.
<Page40>
"Geez. Shiki-san, that was awful what you just did.
I feel sorry for Akiha-sama. If you're going to invite a lover, you should really bring in someone more normal.
If you had done that, then even Akiha-sama would have come to understand."
<Page41>
Kohaku-san gives off an exaggerated sigh and follows after Akiha.
