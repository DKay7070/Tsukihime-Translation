"We need to talk before we eat.
Please have a seat on the sofa."
<Page2>
Those words were simply overwhelming.
The words 'idiotic brother should die' are running amok in my head.
...It seems that I have no choice but to give up and fight here.
<Page3>
"......Okay, please be as brief as possible."
I sat down on the sofa facing Akiha.
<Page4>
Kohaku-san quickly prepared a teacup for me.
She seemed to be saying, "Please do your best," which gives me a little courage.
<Page5>
Yes, even though she is the head of the family, she is still my sister.
I'm sure that this won't be that one-sided.
I take a sip of my tea and looked at Akiha.
<Page6>
"So, what did you want to talk about?"
"Did you have intercourse with the woman from last night?"
"Mmm-hmm!"
<Page7>
It's dangerous, it's dangerous. I'm choking up.
Akiha's first move was to go straight for the jugular.
I almost choked to death on the tea.
<Page8>
"Nii-san, are you listening to me?"
"I'm listening. I heard you."
<Page9>
"Then answer me.
Be as precise as you can about the woman from last night, without lying, and in as much detail as you can without offending me."
<Page10>
"Under those conditions, I can't say a word."
"I warned you not to offend me, didn't I?"
That wasn't a condition, it was a warning. ......!
<Page11>
"......No, I'm starting to smell an impossible task......."
<Page12>
"What is it? Your voice is too low for me to hear. Please speak more clearly.
What kind of person is that woman to your Nii-san?"
<Page13>
"How would you call it, it's like a partnership or a friend......? I mean―――"
<Page14>
"Hmm. You're such a good friends that you spend a lot of time out at night.
Well, I don't have any say on who you may have a relationship with in the future, but you're still a student, aren't you, Nii-san?"
<Page15>
"Shouldn't the eldest son of the Tohno family be ashamed of his shamelessness, spending his nights with a woman he knows nothing about?"
<Page16>
......I see. From Akiha's point of view, Arcueid and I seem to have that kind of relationship.
<Page17>
"Wait, Akiba. First of all, let me tell you that my relationship with her is not like that.
I'm just helping her find what she's looking for, and once she's done, we'll never see each other again."
<Page18>
"......She seemed to be very close to you, but you say it is just my imagination, Nii-san.
Is it just a temporary, profit-and-loss relationship with her?"
<Page19>
Akiha's eyes were cold.
If I nodded my head and said, "That's right," the conversation would come full circle.
......But I had a strange resistance to say so here.
We cooperate with each other because we both have <benefits|pluses>, but if you ask me if that's all, I would argue that it's not that simple.
<Page20>
"It's not that we're... that close, but it's not like I'm just lending a hand for profit or loss."
"Well, I' ve never seen you so upset before. I was wondering what kind of wind was blowing that my brother, who never takes anything seriously, would reveal his emotions."
<Page21>
"I wasn't upset, and I'm not emotionless. It's just that I wasn't expecting her to come to our house, so I was surprised."
"I see. The woman seemed calm and waited for you the whole time, didn't she?"
<Page22>
Her eyes flashed as if she wanted to ask me something.
Akiha seems to believe that Arcueid and I are dating.
<Page23>
"You know, Akiha. That's enough with the misunderstandings.
The reason why that girl and I met in the first place..."
<Page24>
I was about to say that it was because I killed her, but I covered my mouth.
...... There's no way she's going to believe me if I tell her the truth, and there's no way I'm letting Akiha know about it.
However, I couldn't think of a better way to explain it, so I had to continue to mumble my words as I did last night.
<Page25>
"If you can't answer, I'll change the question.
 What is the name of the woman you keep referring to as that one?
"Her name is...... Arcueid,..."
<Page26>
"I see. So it wasn't at school that you made acquaintance, was it? There are no foreign students in your high school."
<Page27>
"Ugu."
 Akiha is right, there are no foreign students in my high school. ......but how does Akiha know all that?
<Page28>
"So, where did you meet that woman, Nii-san?"
"Well, we met on the street. You know, by chance."
<Page29>
"By chance, I see. So it was Arcueid who approached you."
"Ah ――― no, I was the one who approached her......."
In fact, I didn't call out to her, I killed her, and then she chased me. Anyway, I was the one who triggered it.
<Page30>
"Why did you call out to her?
You've never had anything to do with Arcueid. Or were you planning to do that initially?"
<Page31>
Akiha's questions are very precise.
One step at a time, she approaches my vital point.
<Page32>
It's like a frog being stared at by a snake, and soon it'll be forced to the point where I can't hide.
......I feel awful, but I have no choice.
The story should end forcibly at this point.
<Page33>
"Aaahh for heavens sake, Whatever it is, it's nothing personal with her!
What I do is none of Akiha's business.
Because I am only a disowned son anyway, whoever I go out with should not cause any trouble for the Tohno family."
<Page34>
I know it's not fair to bring up the fact that I'm the eldest son who was disowned, but Akiha won't back down unless I do this.
Akiha furrowed her brow, then stood up without a sound.
<Page35>
"――――?"
...... That's funny.
I thought he was going to cut back ruthlessly, but Akiha, on the contrary, awkwardly averted her gaze.
<Page36>
"I didn't want to say this.
......However, I just don't like that person. If it were anyone else, I would give up. But if you allow yourself to be taken by her, it makes me feel like a fool."
<Page37>
...... Why?
Akiha bit her lip in frustration and said something like that.
<Page38>
"What's wrong, Akiha? What's up with you?"
"Enough already. You are free to do as you please, Nii-san......!"
<Page39>
Akiba walked out of the living room, walking in an uncharacteristically rough manner.
<Page40>
"Ahhh. Shiki-san, what you just said was terrible.
I feel sorry for Akiha-sama. If you want to bring your girlfriend, please bring a more normal person.
That way, Akiha-sama woudl've been fine with it."
<Page41>
Kohaku-san sighed and followed after Akiha.
