Regardless of what happened last night, there's no way I can avoid the subject.
Any excuse I make will be like adding fuel to the fire.
Therefore I have no choice but to go in full speed, be fully open and apologize.
I need to cut in with a <wave of force|sorry> before she has a chance to interrogate me.
<Page2>
"So about last night, that wasâ€•"
"Nii-san, may I give you a word of advice?"
<Page3>
And so she says.
Akiha interrupts me with a voice so frightening that it makes me shiver.
<Page4>
"Remember that you are the eldest son of the Tohno family, so I would avoid apologizing jokingly if I were you."
<Page5>
"An apology is something you do when you recognize your own wrongdoings.
In that case, I will have to punish the eldest son of the Tohno family accordingly, wouldn't you agree?"
Her smile was so sadistic that it's possible that I misheard her saying 'I will want to punish'.
<Page6>
Yeah. If I'm not allowed to even apologize, then the only thing left to do is to be killed.
Right, time to scram.

"Sorry Akiha. As the eldest son of the Tohno family, I would like to go to the dining room to get breakfast, is that okay?"
I quietly evacuate towards the dining room.
"Nii-san.#"
Like a door being slammed shut, Akiha raises out a voice calling me to stop.
