There was no excuse for what happened last night.
Any excuse would only add fuel to the fire.
So, I had no choice but to apologize at full speed.
Before Akiha could question me, I had to push her away with a <vigourous|I'm sorry>.

"About last night, that was just..."
"Nii-san, may I give you a word of advice?"
<Page3>
―――And....
Akiha interrupted my words in a terrifying voice.
<Page4>
"You're the eldest son of the Tohno family, so please don't say sorry unnecessarily."
<Page5>
"To apologize is to admit that you were wrong.
In that case, the eldest son of the Tohno family would have to be punished accordingly, right?"
She smiled sadistically in a way that make you think that it could have been misheard as "You want to be punished accordingly, right?".

Hmm. If I'm not even allowed to apologize, the only thing left to do is to get killed.
Okay, let's escape.

"I'm sorry, Akiha. As the eldest son of the Tohno family, I'd like to go to the dining hall for breakfast, if that's okay."
I start my retreat to the dining room.
"Nii-san#."
But the distinct voice of Akiha stopped me in my tracks.
