"―――Ah!"
The moment I open the door, the memory of last night came back to me like a flash of light.
<Page2>
It's amazing. It's really amazing, even for me.
I really want to know what my mental structure is like to be able to forget such a terrible event.
<Page3>
But that is only after I survive this place.
I leave the door open and don't even step inside, I'm frozen like a stone statue.
<Page4>
Meanwhile, in the living room.
I see Akiha sitting on the sofa, as if she were reanacting last night.
<Page5>
Behind Akiha, there is Kohaku-san standing.
Normally, regardless of how cold it sounds, it's always the same.
"Good morning, Nii-san."
But this morning, Akiha doesn't even look at me.
<Page6>
"............"
Needless to say, this is the result of abandoning all obligations to explain Arcueid from last night.
<Page7>
Although she appears to be relaxing elegantly, the pressure oozing out of Akiha is unbearable.
The living room is dominated by a striking tension.
<Page8>
"Good morning, Shiki-san#.
Would you like some tea before breakfast?"
...... Well it seems like it's not something that concerns this me alone.
<Page9>
"Oh, good morning, Kohaku-san. I would like tea again when I get comfortable."
I returned Kohaku-san's greeting and entered the living room.
Akiha stared down at me as I walked in quietly.
I'm not going to be defeated by silent pressure.

It's times like these that the true potential of the human will is tested.
I...
C:>I greet cheerfully.
C:>I will say hello.
C:>I have no other choice but to apologize.
