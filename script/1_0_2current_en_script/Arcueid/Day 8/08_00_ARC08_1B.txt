"―――Ah."
The moment I open the door, the memories of what happened last night come back like a flash of light.
<Page2>
Amazing. How truly amazing, even for me.
For me to forget such a terrifying event, I should seriously ask to get scanned at least once to find out what's happening with my mental state.
<Page3>
However, that should be a topic of discussion for after I survive.
With the door still open, I remain solid like a statue, refusing to take another step.
<Page4>
Meanwhile in the living room...
Akiha is sitting on the sofa like she was reheated from last night.
<Page5>
Kohaku-san is standing behind her.
Usually I would receive some biting remark by now,
but Akiha, who would usually greet me with 'Good morning, Nii-san',
doesn't even give me a single glance this morning.
<Page6>
"......"
Needless to say, this is the result of me abandoning my duty of giving an explanation about Arcueid from last night.
<Page7>
It may appear like Akiha is relaxing gracefully, but the pressure exuding from her is no small matter.
The living room is dominated by an immediate air of tension.
<Page8>
"Good morning, Shiki-san#.
Would you like some tea before breakfast?"
...Well, none of this matters to her at least.
<Page9>
"G-Good morning Kohaku-san. I think I'll have tea some other time."
I return my greetings to Kohaku-san and enter the living room.
Akiha gives me a sidelong glance as I sneakily walk inside with hushed steps.
I'm not going to falter to this silent pressure.
<Page10>
It's times like these where the power of humans are truly tested.
I'll...
C:>give her nothing but a cheerful greeting.
C:>give her a quiet greeting.
C:>...In any case, I have no choice but to apologize.
