"...The hospital at Kushizuka..."
Not that Arcueid had anything to do with it, but I'm starting to feel that it wouldn't be such a bad idea to investigate such an ominous place during the day.
The fact that the place is two stations away is irrelevant, but I still have time until nightfall, so I should check it out for the time being.

From the terminal at Kushizuka station, I take a bus for 20 minutes.
It takes another 20 minutes by foot to arrive from the closest bus stop.
In the middle of the industrial district far away from the residential areas, the building that used to be a hospital is now quietly rotting away like a corpse.

"――――――"
I can see how large it is on the inside even from the main gate.
It must have been a very large hospital before it was closed down.

The peeled-off asphalt has been eroded by the grass.
The faraway ward is crumbling in several places.
I wonder if it broke down due to a fire.
However, the differences between the broken areas and the ones that are not are too severe.

"――――――"
The sky looks so high over here.
Without any tall buildings in the surrounding area, the view is filled with nothing but a vast blue sky.
Even though it's hardly close to dusk, its clarity is so vivid that it makes my eyes hurt.

I cut the barbed wire with my knife and went inside the site for a little while, but I wasn't able to find anything particularly abnormal.
...I even resolved myself and took off my glasses, but I wasn't able to see the disarranged lines like in that man.
In the end, this was just another abandoned building that had been forgotten by everyone.
<Page7>
"――――――"
It was a waste of time, but that's just a normal part of investigating. I return to the main gate and check the timetable for the next bus.
There is a bus coming in 10 minutes. If I run now, I'll barely be able to make it in time.
Shrugging my shoulders in disappointment, I decide to run toward the bus stop.
