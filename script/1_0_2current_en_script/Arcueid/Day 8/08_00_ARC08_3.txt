My everyday life moves forward without a hitch.
Fourth period, Modern Society.
The teacher at the podium reads out a rather bland, uninspiring text.
As I calmly listen, I take advantage of the window seat and stare objectively at my reflection on the windowpane.
<Page2>
"......"
...I can't concentrate at all.
It's not because the lesson was boring, but that I can't make sense of my situation.
<Page3>
The conflagration in front of the station that took many victims.
The city being invaded by a vampire.
With those things in mind, I continue to think about myself as I quietly listened to the class.
<Page4>
Needless to say, I have been acting strange.
If it was any other person in my case, they would have either stayed indoors or run someplace far away.
<Page5>
And yet here I am, grabbing hold of my everyday life as if nothing's ever happened.
As if to convince myself that things like vampires are just an anomaly and that it is no reason to abandon my everyday life.
<Page6>
"...But if I were to be honest..."
It could be that as a student, I simply could not neglect going to school.
<Page7>
I recall the conversation I had with Saiki Gotou in the mansion.
If I were to put it in his words, studying is an investment for the future.
It would be backwards to abandon building one's future just for the mere security of the present.
<Page8>
Besides, I'm living off the money from the Tohno family to begin with. If I'm going to be living in that home, I should at least fulfil the bare minimum as a student. This is not question of obligation but rather a matter of duty.
<Page9>
Perhaps I should call this servility, or even stubbornness.
Or maybe it's just be being thickheaded.
I remember Sensei telling me to 'Become the person that I think is right.'
As long as I still live by those words, there's no way I can do anything else but treasure my everyday life.
<Page10>
My eyes squint at the sunlight coming through the glass window.
Fourth period will come to a close in another 20 minutes.
Today's lessons will go up to fifth period.
<Page11>
I think about the idea of working together with Arcueid again once school ends and day turns to night.
The face reflected in the glass window breaks out into a seemingly enjoyable smile.
<Page12>
"――――Hmph."
I tighten my mouth.
It's not like I enjoy roaming around the night city with Arcueid, so what the hell am I smiling about?
<Page13>
"...Geez..."
Even if I'm not able to concentrate on the lesson, this is going too far.
I can't believe that I'm starting to see illusions like that woman elegantly walking around the campus through the glass window.
<Page14>
―――Wait, that's not an illusion at all!!!
<Page15>
I bend myself forward a little bit in order to not disturb the class, or rather, so that no one in the class takes notice.
Please tell me that there's something wrong with my eyes...!
<Page16>
Yeah, that definitely ain't no illusion.
That thing is not floating in the air. It's the real thing no matter how much I lie to myself.
Is it possible that vampire's brain is nothing but clear weather 24/7?!
<Page17>
What do I do? If I leave things as they are, what on Earth will happen to my school life?
<Page18>
"......"
Calm down, it's still fine. There's no problem yet.
The other students haven't noticed her, and I don't hear any uproar from the neighboring classrooms. Fortunately, it seems that this classroom is the only location from which we can see her right now.
<Page19>
"That woman is truly a destroyer from the very start...!"
Troubled, I curse her from the bottom of my heart.
However, doing that does not solve anything.
<Page20>
There's 20 minutes left until lunch break.
If I leave that airhead vampire alone, there's no telling what kind of mess she will create.
<Page21>
I'll―――
C:>intercept her with full force.
C:>focus on the class with all my might.
C:>ignore her as best as I can.
