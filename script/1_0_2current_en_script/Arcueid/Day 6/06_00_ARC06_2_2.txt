I'll let Dr. Arach take care of me.
I still don't know what kind of person she is, but since she's wearing a white coat, I'm pretty sure that she's a doctor.
<Page2>
"Understood. I'll let Dr. Arach know that you're looking for her, so please wait in your room in the meantime.
Dr. Arach is an unpredictable person, but there is no doubt about her skills as a doctor. You will be seeing her often during your stay here, so please use this opportunity to get to know her better."
<Page3>
Akiha's voice was plain and unconcerned.
It was the kind of simplicity similar to a person delivering a message.
...Now then.
For now, I'll have breakfast and then get some medical treatment afterwards.
<Page4>
I pass the time in my room by doing things like reading a paperback book.
Right as it's about to reach 10 AM, I catch a glimpse of a white coat strolling down the hallway through the window.
I put my book away, realizing that she was finally here.
At the same time,
<Page5>
"Hiii, mornin' chan!
So you want to play with my body first thing in the morning? #Shiki-chan, so leeewd! #I must be falling prey to the overflowing stew-like juvenile puberty disease!"
<Page6>
Without even knocking, a drunken person walks inside with a fancy bag in hand.
I regret that I didn't choose Kohaku-san this time.
<Page7>
"I'm sorry. It seems that I asked for the wrong person, so can I ask you to leave?"
"Aah, just kidding, it was a joke but I'm totally serious. It's been a while since I got to examine an outside patient, so I wasn't sure how close I should be. I was contemplating on whether it would be better to use a more frank greeting, you know."
<Page8>
As she continues to ramble, Dr. Arach has already walked all the way to the bed. That flashy model-like stride... Her chest and hips swing more than necessary... But despite this, not a single footstep can be heard, like a ninja stealthily moving along.
<Page9>
Normally I would expect her to make a loud sound with her heels, but since this is a medical examination, maybe she has decided to take it a little more seriously.
<Page10>
"Nooow, without further ado, show me the affected area. Show it immediately. In fact, just take off your clothes! After all, I can't hold back my overflowing desires for even a second, so be quick or I'll eat you ♡"
"You're... not drunk, are you?"
<Page11>
"I didn't drink, okay? I'm always sober 24/7. The closest thing I have to alcohol is drinking hot choccy you know. Choco."
...She's right. I don't smell any alcohol.
So this level of tension is just normal for her.
<Page12>
"Oh, so now you're being more honest. But are you really just going to roll up your hem? What about your pants? Won't you strip down to your underwear? A man's naked body stays beautiful until they're 25 at most, so wouldn't it be a waste to not get into the habit of exposing yourself while you still can?"
"It's fine so just hurry up and examine me, professor.
Even I have a limit when it comes to patience."
<Page13>
"Did you just say 'professor'? Hey, did you just call me 'professor'? So I do look like one, right?!"
"...Well. You are wearing a lab coat, and like, you know..."
You could say that she's the embodiment of a mad scientist. //kuristiiiiina
<Page14>
"Lovely. Lovely like Lady Godiva. Right, time to get a little serious."
<Page15>
Dr. Arach takes a seat and palpates my legs.
...It was a strange feeling.
Rather than feeling like her fingers were tracing my skin, it felt like they were trickling down. A thumping sound can be heard from inside my body, but there was no pain at all.
It was as if the palpation was like the sonar of a submarine.
<Page16>
"Oh no, there's a crack in your bone.
You are quite the masochist, aren't you? Because normally, people wouldn't be able to tolerate this kind of pain!"
<Page17>
Ah... So that's how it is.
Though I'm glad that it's only a fracture.
I wouldn't be surprised if things were broken all over my body.
<Page18>
"Hmm, but it's strange, isn't it? If there's a crack, then it's weird that there's nothing broken around it. #Hmm... #Let me get that covered at once."
"Wah?! Y-Y-You, what did you do just now?!"
<Page19>
"Just a bit of antiseptic. #Hmm, but it doesn't seem like it's necessary to cut it open. It should heal on its' own by tomorrow if I keep it steady. How boooring."
<Page20>
Dr. Arach... Professor Arach scratches her head with discontent and takes out some medical equipment from her bag.
She puts on a new pair of gloves straight out of the seal and prepares a syringe.
<Page21>
"I'll give you some painkillers, just in case. It's not necessary, but the family head did tell me to be more deliberate after all."
<Page22>
With a fluid hand movement, Professor Arach gives me an injection on my left leg.
After that, she tapes my heel in place and wraps it in a bandage, thus completing the treatment.
...It really was a brilliant job.
It's even comparable to the old man from the clinic that I owe a great deal to back at the Arima house. This person might even be an excellent physician if only she could keep her mouth shut.
<Page23>
"Thank you very much. I feel better now thanks to you."
"Don't mention it. Besides, I'm not licensed and this is outside my expertise. I'm mainly a scientist after all. #Not to mention that Shiki-chan called me a professor.
<Page24>
It appears that she is very happy to be called professor.
...Based on this situation, it seems that Akiha and the others have never called her that up until now.
<Page25>
"But, Shiki-chan, it looks like you pushed your body through quite a bit. It's as if you were testing the limits of your human mobility."
Personally, I love that kind of reckless behavior, so I won't stop you as a doctor."
"Oh. But you're not a doctor of my profession, right?"
<Page26>
"Kyaaa, Shiki-chan, you're so strict ♡
You look gentle, but you must be cold-blooded deep inside. Right? Is it not just your body but a hybrid including your mind? #Or rather, you, how much do you even know about your own body?"
<Page27>
"...Um, are you referring to my anemia?"
"That's not it, I was talking about your muscles and physique. Or engine and frame, if you prefer it. I noticed that you had an unusual body after feeling you for a bit."
<Page28>
"Muscles can either be a fast-twitch muscle that focuses on explosive power or a slow-twitch muscle that focuses on endurance, with you being mainly the former. That's all well and good but... how do I put this... it's light. It's not the skeletal structure, but the bones themselves that feel light. It's like you were born with the ability to manipulate your weight and float. Or something like that?"
<Page29>
"What are you talking about. Light bones... what am I, a bird?"
<Page30>
"Ah yeah, it's just like that!
These kinds of things don't come naturally, you know. Your build is quite sophisticated. You're exactly like a thoroughbred that was born to run for only 10 seconds.
Ufufu. Even though you two are siblings, you are the exact opposite of the head of the family ♡"
"...I'm the exact opposite, of Akiha?"
<Page31>
"Yup. All children of the Tohno family are born with the combination of both superior and old genes, the result of hetero-breeding. But the family head is a bit of an exception. Or rather, a special case. Or maybe a miracle?
Atavism... Or otherwise known as skipping a generation. She possesses a pure pattern from before the entire process of breeding.
That's right. If you were a once-in-a-decade talent, then she would be... 10 years, 100 years, 1000 years, well then, how many years do you think she would be?"
<Page32>
Professor Arach brings up the matter with a wry smile on her face.
I think―――
C:>Once in a decade?
C:>Once in a century?
C:>Once in a millenium?
