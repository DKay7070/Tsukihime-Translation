"Nope, all those answers are completely wrong!
It would be absurd to even compare them against such unnatural talent!
Our precious head of the family is a once-in-a-lifetime monster after all!"
<Page2>
With a cackling sound, Dr. Arach laughs happily from the bottom of her heart.
...I unknowingly clench my fists towards her attitude.
<Page3>
"Oh my, are you mad because I spoke ill of your sister? But that was my way of showing the highest degree of love."
"Is that so. Even if that's the case, please don't talk like that ever again."
<Page4>
...I don't want her to be described as a monster.
Now that I know the truth about vampires, I can't tolerate it when humans use that word.
And against Akiha nonetheless. Never again.

"Oh dear, did I step on a landmine? Kya, I'm so scared! I'm so scared that I'm going home!"
Dr. Arach makes a tapping sound with her heel as she runs to the door.
I have no intention of calling her to stop.
<Page6>
However, the woman in the lab coat stops in front of the door, turning around with a grin on her face.

"But as a professor, I'll give you a small warning.
In case you're planning get hurt like this in the future, I'll give you some words of advice, Shiki-chan. Your body does seem pretty beat up after all. How about it? Don't you want to take off the seven years of waste? Although it's definitely going to hurt like hell!" //I don't know if it's "waste" or not, pls recheck this, I might be wrong tho.
<Page8>
I don't know what she's trying to say.
All I know is that I have a feeling of disgust deep inside that makes me want to reject her offer.
<Page9>
"...I respectfully decline. Besides, this sort of thing won't happen again."
"Yeah, it would be great if that was the case.
Laters, ciao â™¡ I'll always be waiting for you."
<Page10>
Dr. Arach leaves the room after giving me a throwaway kiss.
...I should pull myself together.
Now that I'm able to move, I need to figure out how to spend my afternoon.
