The gentle rays of the sun dispel my sleepiness.
Even with my eyes closed, I can feel the silence around me through the sensation of my skin.
The air is moderately cool, yet gentle.
The sky seems to be the clearest it's ever been today.
<Page2>
In that case, I should get up and go to school.
After all, I've been met with misfortune for the past two days that I forgot I was a student―――
<Page3>
"......."
...I wake up.
My body is laying on the bed, and my glasses are next to my pillow.
<Page4>
I put them on by reflex and let my gaze wander.
The sunlight through the window is so bright that I can almost hear it calling me outside.
<Page5>
I take a deep breath #and take in the fresh air.
...I see. It's Sunday, so there's no school.
<Page6>
The hands of the clock make a ticking sound.
I can hear the birds chirping outside.
―――Ah, I'm back.
It was a morning like usual, but now it feels so much purer.
<Page7>
"―――Thank goodness."
It's not because I'm alive, or that I was able to do something about that <vampire|V l o v >.
It was that I was able to go back to my normal life after going through that extraordinary event. That I can happily enjoy a morning like this.
There is no greater reward for a small person like me―――
<Page8>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama.#"
"UWAAAAAAH!"
<Page9>
My upper body jumped up before I realized it.
I look over and see Hisui standing by the door.
<Page10>
"H-Hisui―――"
<Page11>
"...My sincerest apologies.
It seemed that you were rather unaware of my presence, so I decided to call out to you, but..."
"Ah―――no, well, I'm sorry as well."
<Page12>
I'm surprised.
My heart races as soon as I get up...
<Page13>
"...Huh? But it's not even 7 o'clock."
"Yes. It is a little earlier than when you usually wake up, Shiki-sama."
"I guess so. So what brings you all the way here, Hisui?"
<Page14>
"I have come here to wake you up.
I received orders from Akiha-sama to bring you to explain the situation of the past two days, even as far as using force if necessary."
<Page15>
"――――――"
'Akiha', 'the past two days', 'explain'.
The cryptic words fly around inside my brain.
<Page16>
I take ten seconds to think as I resist the temptation to abandon my thoughts.
...Come to think of it. Or rather, no matter how much I consider it, there is no point in explaining what happened these past two days.
<Page17>
Absence without consent. Curfew violation. On top of that, lack of communication.
Akiha is scary enough when I don't come home before dusk. I can't even imagine what kind of face she's making right now.
<Page18>
"...Hey, Hisui.
To put it mildly, is Akiha, mad at me...?"
<Page19>
"That I wonder.
You will have to find out for yourself, Shiki-sama."
<Page20>
Okay. It seems that Hisui's voice is also somewhat cold for whatever reason.
If it was going to be like this, I should have returned to the mansion even if I had to crawl―――
Wait, crawl?
<Page21>
"No, wait a minute.
Before that, why was I asleep in my room...?"
"You returned to the mansion last night past two o'clock.
Nee-san noticed that you were asleep at the entrance and brought you to your room, or so I have been told."
<Page22>
"――――――――"
...My mouth hangs wide open.
I came home late at night without notice and slept at the door without going back to my room, like some wild drunk who missed the last train.
<Page23>
"That woman, to treat people the same way as cats or something..."
Arcueid's face springs to mind.
...Well, I guess I should be grateful that she carried me to the doorway at the very least.
<Page24>
In any case, I understand the situation now.
"I'll go there right away, so if you could, well... ask Akiha to calm down as best as possible, then it would be much appreciated..."
<Page25>
"I am deeply sorry. I will have to refuse that order due to various reasons."
<Page26>
Hisui replies firmly.
It's safe to say that my current status within the Tohno mansion has fallen to the lowest level.
Since Akiha is the head of the mansion, it's no surprise that I have no allies when she's upset.
<Page27>
...That being said, I should get up.
I can't begin by staying in bed forever.
<Page28>
"―――"
O―――uch.
As soon as I stand up, I feel a pain in my legs as if they're being teared apart.
<Page29>
...So that's how it is. If I were to ask myself what I should be surprised about, it would be the fact that I'm still alive.
After doing all those crazy things, it would be unnatural for me to be greeted by the morning like this.
<Page30>
"Shiki-sama...?
Is there anything I can do to help? You are... sweating, heavily."
<Page31>
A large amount of sweat drips from my forehead.
It seems that the pain of trying to walk alone is enough to cause my body to react that way.
<Page32>
"...If you are not feeling well, perhaps you would prefer to take a rest for a little while longer."
I believe that you made a sound earlier, but if I put in a word to Akiha-sama..."
<Page33>
"No, it's alright. It's just a sprain, it'll go away soon.
But more importantly, I'm more afraid of Akiha. If I keep making her wait, she'll just get even angrier."
"――――"
<Page34>
Hisui's eyes urge me as if they were asking me not to tell lies.
However, due to her position, she cannot make any inquiry on my lie.
...I'm really sorry, but I'll have to rely on this obvious subterfuge to make you agree.
<Page35>
"I'll go to the lobby when I'm dressed.
It won't take long, so just wait for me in the hallway."
<Page36>
"...As you wish.
I sincerely hope that you do not push yourself too hard, by all means."
<Page37>
Hisui bows deeply and leaves the room.
I change out of my sleep-wear and into my casual clothes, trying to move my body as little as possible.
My first day off back at my home in seven years heads off with a rocky start.
