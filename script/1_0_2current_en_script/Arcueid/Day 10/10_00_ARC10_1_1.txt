 I arrive at the main gate.
 I chose a secluded route, so it took me a while to get here.
 Arcueid is ...... here.

"Here I am. Let's go get moving, Arcueid. If we stay around the mansion, Kohaku-san will find us."
"Huh? Oh, yeah, if we're gonna get going, we should get moving."
 Unlike earlier, Arcueid's response is lackluster.
<Page3>
"Hey, this isn't like you.
 Did something happen to you again while you were waiting for me?"
<Page4>
"...... No, nothing happened."
 I emphasized the "again" part, but Arcueid's reply was dull.
<Page5>
"'...... Maybe you're not feeling well because it's daytime?
 There's no need to force yourself to go out. If you're in pain, you can stop―――"
<Page6>
"No, I'm feeling fine. I was just looking at this wall and it reminded me of yesterday."
"Yesterday, you mean when you waited for me in the park?"
 "Yes," Arcueid said, nodding with a strange look on her face.

 I don't know why I was so angry. I've broken many promises in the past."
 "I really don't understand," Arcueid said, her arms crossed in thought.
<Page8>
"Hey, do you know what this is, Shiki?
 You're always telling me I'm ridiculous, so you should be able to figure this out, right?"
<Page9>
"That's......"
 If Arcueid herself doesn't understand it, how can I possibly know?
 I don't know, but if I have to answer, I'll go with――――
C:> "Maybe you're just easily upset, Arcueid.//Okay, so this is the dumbass option.
C:> You're basically just being selfish."
C:> I clearly express my honest opinion.
