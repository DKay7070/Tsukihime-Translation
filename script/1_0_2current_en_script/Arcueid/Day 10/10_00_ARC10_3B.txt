 At any rate, we head toward the station, the center of Soya.
"Let's go, let's go♪"
 Arcueid goes down the hill ahead of me.
 She's like a child who's excited to go on an errand for the first time.
<Page2>
"By the way, Shiki, you're dressed differently today.
 What happened to your usual black outfit?"
"My usual black outfit..."
<Page3>
 ...I see. In her mind, "Tohno Shiki in the daytime → school uniform" is the standard.
 Also, our school uniforms are blue, not black. Please don't fixate on people with dark imagery whenever you get a chance.
<Page4>
"You know, I can't just walk around in a school uniform in the middle of the day.
 Today is a da- a special day to explore the city, right? That's why I've changed into slightly more elegant casual clothes.
 Well, I've only changed my shoes from sneakers to leather shoes, but it's better than nothing.
<Page5>
"――――――I see. Something special, is it?"
"?"
 Arcueid pauses, as if thinking of something,
<Page6>
"Shiki. Stop there, turn right, and close your eyes.
 Hmm, yeah. I'll give you ten seconds, no, three seconds."
<Page7>
"?　By turning right, you mean turning around?"
 She said it so casually that I followed his instructions without question.
<Page8>
 I turn around and close my eyes.
 Only after my eyes are closed do I question what I'm doing, but I try to remain calm.
"Fufu. Watch this, I'm not going to lose!"
"?"
<Page9>
 Can't lose, to what?
　...wait, I suddenly feel a strange wind pressure behind me!
<Page10>
"Hey, what do you mean, #by#―――#"
 Before I can finish, my mouth, no, my brain stops.
<Page11>
"What do you think?　I don't have to fight in the daytime, so I thought it wouldn't be a hindrance if I wore this."
<Page12>
"――――――"
 ...This is bad.
 What the hell, what the hell, what the hell...!
 What's that everyday wear? What's with the fur? What's with the ribbon? I'm not sure how she changed her clothes in the blink of an eye, and I'm not sure where she got the clothes, but she looks so good that it doesn't matter.
<Page13>
"Hey. Am I a different person than usual?　Am I cute?"
"―――Oh, oh―――"
 Saying it like that, y-you, you, you――――!
<Page14>
 You know.
 Cute? I'm not talking about that kind of thing.
 This is something outside of my understanding. Outside the realm of reason.
 Please don't tell me that vampires are even fully equipped with dating clothes.
 I've always been amazed, and now there's more? What are you, some kind of gravure idol? Some kind of <anthropomorphic|cute   > bunny? Honestly, I want to take a picture of it right now.
 I mean, do you know anything but foul play, you monster?
<Page15>
"Hmph. I can't tell if this is good or bad if you won't say anything!
 It's a special day, so it's better this way, isn't it, Shiki?"
<Page16>
"Good or bad, you―――"
 Of course it's bad. This kind of mental violation is unacceptable. As a representative of humanity, I want to protest that she's a bad person.
 But, is there anyone on earth who can say "no" to this Arcueid...?
<Page17>
"(G-Guh...!)"
 I grit my teeth and hold back the <self|heart  > that wants to surrender immediately.
 Gathering every ounce of pride in my body, 
"―――Sure. If that's the case, theres, no, problem."
 I reply to Arcueid, barely maintaining my dignity as a human being.
<Page18>
 ...Although I was damaged early on by the unexpected turn of events, I have the advantage of familar territory.
 It's okay, there's nothing to panic about.
 I have to get back on track and reign in Arcueid as I always have.
<Page19>
"...Alright.
 Arcueid, do you have anywhere you want to go or something like that?"
<Page20>
"I don't know this place, so I'll leave it to you.
 Take me somewhere suitable."
"............"
<Page21>
 With a "What do you want for dinner?" "Anything is fine." response,
 She seems to be taking it easy, but she's giving me a very difficult request...
 I don't have any idea where Arcueid would like to go, but I'll have to come up with some ideas before we get to the station.
<Page22>
 Fortunately, I have a good amount of cash in my wallet.
 Our destination is―――
C:>Although it's a little cliche, the movie theater.
C:>After all, it has to be a gloomy back alley.
C:>Since it's a beautiful day, let's take a walk in the park.
