"...Aaagh ...AAAAAAAAGH!"
With that, the man woke up in a great deal of pain.
<Page2>
Deafening agony.
A clashing sound, like metal scraps in a blender.
An unearthly scream,
that makes even his followers tremble in fear.
<Page3>
"Aaa―――aaaah, aaaaaaaah―――!"
He thrashes, flails, and lashes out at his surroundings yet the pain does not disappear from his consciousness.
<Page4>
The skin is torn from his fingertips.
Acid oozes from the core of his bones, melting his body from the inside out.
His heart becomes necrotic within minutes, and each time it regenerates, the pain reappears along with it.
<Page5>
The torture will never end as long as he lives.
His only release would be death.
But even that salvation was lost long ago.
<Page6>
"A―――ah, aa―――h, gh―――"
The man does not remember why he parted ways with death.
Nor when exactly death became so far away.
Only agony. Cold. Painful. Hot. Frightening.
All that remains in his head are those animal-like screams.
<Page7>
The man recalls that he came to this land in order to chase something. In order to kill.
He left his beloved <mistresses|t h i n g s     > behind in his territory and crossed that vast expanse of ocean.
This was his last chance.
He resolved to take everything back, knowing this was it.
<Page8>
But what exactly was it that makes this his last chance?
Was it the sanity weakening day by day in his head?
Was it the curses accumulating day by day in his body?
Or was it all to make up for the crimes he bears from days gone by?
<Page9>
He cannot recall. He has already forgotten so much.
But if he came here for the purpose of regaining his sanity, then it is far too late.
He lost his mind long ago. He can't just go back to normal after all this time.
When he crossed the ocean, most of his accumulated fortune was washed away. He can no longer return to his homeland. He has no means to survive other than to claim this ground as his own.
<Page10>
"Ha―――h, aa, ah, AA――――――!"
It doesn't matter. Those kinds of trivial things don't matter.
The only thing he wants now is blood.
<Page11>
His throat is freezing. His skin is dry. His soul is starving.
He needs warm blood as soon as possible.
He wants to bathe in human blood as soon as he can.
Those questions of where he is or what he's doing are nothing when compared to the desires deep in his heart.
<Page12>
Walking through the darkness.
He marches with the dead in tow.
He exits the vertically moving cab and crawls out onto the sunbathed ground above.
At the same time.
The blue flames spread like encroaching water.
<Page13>
Not a single <creature|h u m a n   > sensed the danger that had now dyed the land.
Even as the man, shrouded in blue mist, wandered into the crosswalk against a traffic light and was hit by a van.
Even as the ghouls that the man brought along effortlessly grabbed the pedestrians' shoulders, pushed them down and started creating those messy sounds.
<Page14>
Even as the people raised their voices in shock, none of them gave it their all to run away.
By the time they realized that it was not just someone else's problem, but rather an anomaly that affected them all, they had already lost their chance.
<Page15>
The van that was supposed to have run over the man was split in two upon impact.
The pedestrians who had been pushed down by the ghouls were nothing but leftovers in less than a minute.
The flames that had already spread throughout the area burned the legs of the fleeing people, turning them into nothing but a crawling meal.
It was the beginning of pandemonium.
<Page16>
"――――――Why."
The man summons a faint sense of reason in the midst of it all.
The dazzling light makes him squint.
His thoughts, smeared with pain,
begin to spin with exceeding discomfort.
<Page17>
"Why is this city... so bright?
Filth is something that must be hidden.
Is it a custom of this land to create such a deliberate spectacle?"
<Page18>
An abundance of <fruit|h u m a n s   > lay before his eyes.
Normally he would disembowel and drain them dry with joy, but that urge did not spring forth.
The man roars, as if to say 'Even if this place is full of humans, can it really be called a fertile land?'
<Page19>
"The humans are plenty. Blood shall not be an issue."
A blue flame sweeps over the dead.
The ghouls are quickly engulfed by the flames, which transform their bodies.
The blazing dead are driven by fire.
Their abilities improve, but their bodies burn out in a short period of time.
<Page20>
"However, I am not interested in the blood of these swine."
The curses are propagated by his visceral disgust.
Blue flames that only burn living things flood the street.
A river of flame gushes forth and begins to flow.
<Page21>
"In the end, it's all meaningless."
The man crushes the flame-grilled fruit beneath his foot and accepts the gushing blood shamefully.
Even though it's the equivalent of being bathed in vomit, it can't be helped.
The man curses his own misfortune. He can't move without bathing himself in this vomit.
"All of this radiance, and all of this prosperity, it means nothing to me."
<Page22>
The man continues his march, bringing along the burning and crumbling corpses with him.
He does not remember his ultimate goal,
but until he can, there was only one thing left for him to do.
He comes to the realization that this endeavor was worthwhile after all.
'Suffer and die', he laughs.
A gluttonous city like this deserves an unsightly end.
