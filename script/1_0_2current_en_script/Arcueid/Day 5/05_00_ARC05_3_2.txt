"――――――"
If I'm being honest, I don't think we can let Vlov off the hook for even a second.
...But going after him now would be too reckless.
<Page2>
Tracking him down and defeating him as we are right now? It's not even worth considering.
That kind of wishful thinking is just an irresponsible escape from reality to ease my own guilt.
<Page3>
...I need to collect myself.
I have to if I really want to defeat that vampire.
I understand that if I truly wish to reduce the number of casualties, I have no choice but to wait here.
<Page4>
But still―――three days is far too long.
<Page5>
"...Arcueid.
You said that my duty as a guard ended yesterday, right?"
<Page6>
"I did say that, but... what? Did you get cold feet after all?"
"No, that's not what I mean. If we're doing this as a team and not of out of obligation, then I have a favor to ask of you.
I will do as you say. I'll follow your instructions. I may not be able to act as your shield, but I can at least become your knife.
That's why, in return―――"
<Page7>
"In return?"
"―――I can't wait three days. Let's lure him out tonight."
<Page8>
"Um... are you being serious?"
Arcueid is taken aback by my suicidal remark.
I am fully aware of how dangerous it is. Even so, there is a line that I cannot cross.
<Page9>
"You think I could joke about something like this?
I don't want to die either. So please listen to me. If you rest until tonight, could you defeat Vlov if you had the help of my eyes?"
<Page10>
Arcueid is the only one who can judge that.
That's why... if she decides that it's possible, then I will wager everything on that possibility.
<Page11>
"...I see. If you move exactly the way I tell you to, then I guess we'd have the upper hand.
But is that really okay? It would be much safer to just wait three days you know."
"...I know that. But this is as much as I can handle. I can't wait any longer." // dropping mentally intentionally here because its awkward in english.
<Page12>
"Hmm... well, in that case, it's fine.
And to be honest, there's only a small chance that we'd be able to avoid him for three days anyway."
<Page13>
"So I guess from here on this is a strategy meeting.
Where do you want to fight, Shiki?"
"Eh? Wait, but... is that really okay?"
<Page14>
I couldn't help but confirm I'd understood her right.
I didn't think that Arcueid――someone who takes battle seriously――would listen to my request so readily.
<Page15>
"I told you, it's fine.//ruby dots <そ|・><れ|・>
Either we keep running for three days, or we find and kill Vlov tonight.
Both options have the same chance of success. The only difference is how likely you are to make it out alive."
<Page16>
"...I see. Thank you, Arcueid."
"I wouldn't recommend it though.
You really are a mystery, Shiki."
<Page17>
I've increased my chances against Vlov.
It's only natural that Arcueid can't understand; she's someone who values efficiency and certainty.
But even so, Arcueid didn't veto my idea.
<Page18>
I wonder if it's because she respects my feelings, or if it's because the odds wouldn't change either way.
Well, in any case, I'm grateful that she's on board at least.
