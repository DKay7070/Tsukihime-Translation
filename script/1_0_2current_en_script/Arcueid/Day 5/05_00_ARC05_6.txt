"Ha, ha―――!"
As I leave the building, I see a pile of debris in front of me.
I crouch down and advance, stopping just at the rim of the crater.

The pit is now 40 meters deep.
This area used to be a park.
But there's no trace of it anymore.
The rubble forms a slope that leads down to the foot of the pit.
Although it'd be impossible to climb up from the bottom, I should be able to slide down even with legs like mine.
With that said―――
C:> I should go down.
C:> I should observe the situation.
