The city is in a frenzied panic.
I run through the crowded streets.
The fire in front of the station can be seen even from here.
<Page2>
The screens outside broacast the breaking news on repeat.
A fire had broken out in the vicinity of Souya Station's north exit.
The trains are suspended and the people who were visiting the downtown area are frantically running for their lives.
<Page3>
A news anchor is reporting the emergency news on the outdoor screens. //text overflow, the entire page needs rephrasing 
It's an interview with a high school girl who has just escaped the fire.
"It's hot, it's hot. Hey, why is it so hot?
My friend, Yuka, just got eaten by them. They even got my arm. It's like...
They're moving even though they're dead! They're burning but they're laughing...!"
Her words were treated as delusions due to the extreme conditions she had escaped
<Page4>
The fire is spreading even now, to the point where nearby residents are told to evacuate.
Even with that, the main street is overflowing with people.
From the surrounding area, people come out of curiosity to watch, photograph and forward the situation to their closest friends.
<Page5>
"...!"
The road to the station is already blocked off.
Fire prevention... no, it would be too early for that. More importantly, there are too many people around.
It's almost like they're guarding the exits to make sure nobody inside can escape.
<Page6>
"Crap...!"
Either way, can't go this way.
"Shiki, over here."
She pulls my hand with force.
<Page7>
Without asking for my permission, Arcueid grips my hand as she slips through the crowd of people.
<Page8>
"H-Hang on a second!
Why did you take me all the way here?"
<Page9>
I shake my hand free.
As Arcueid looks up at the wall of the building, she says..
<Page10>
"Yeah. This should be enough.
This is my first time flying with another person, but it shouldn't be an issue going only this high."
"Huh?"
<Page11>
She moves without hesitation.
Arcueid grasps my arm as if she were pinning me down, and then...
<Page12>
"We're going to fly. Hold on tight, Shiki."
She just says something completely outrageous―――!
<Page13>
"Wah."
<Page14>
"Waah."
<Page15>
"WAAAAAAAAAAAHHH―――――!?"
<Page16>
We're flying.
No, we're jumping.
<Page17>
Arcueid jumps towards the building wall, bouncing off it after a bit and repeating the motion again in the opposite direction. Before I realize it, we're above the building, no, soaring across the sky.
Of course, she did all of this while grabbing me by her side.
<Page18>
"W-W-Wait a, waaaaaah...!"
It's so high! I'm terrified! How many meters above ground is this? That building must have been around 40 meters and we're above that!? Even a 20-meter drop-tower ride would make my heart shrink, let alone this! Not to mention our complete lack of safety gear!
<Page19>
"Hmm? Shiki, you'll bite your tongue off if you open your mouth like that."
<Page20>
As I tilt my head to cover my screaming, Arcueid ramps up the brutal pace even more.
We hop off of each rooftop from building to building. Just like a rabbit hopping on the moon.
<Page21>
"Uoh, Uooh, Uoooooooooh―――!?"
My face tightens because of this unfamiliar experience.
Just as I was starting to enjoy it, at long last, Arcueid stops leaping.
<Page22>
It's the rooftop of a skyscraper overlooking the city.
We have landed on an aerial garden that was not originally designed for humans to enter.
<Page23>
"Eh―――you, w-what the hell was that about―――"
<Page24>
The onslaught of up and down movements disrupted my breathing.
My chest is in pain. The disordered blood circulation created a strain on my heart.
Although there's no change in the air pressure, my entire body becomes rigid from the sudden experience that I never had before.
<Page25>
"Look. Over there."
"What do you mean, look ther―――"
<Page26>
I stop just before I could finish my sentence.
At that moment, I forget all about the pain of my elevated heart rate.
<Page27>
―――It's burning.
The city I live in, the familiar buildings, are all being consumed by the river of flames.
"What――――――"
My eyes begin to reveal the full extent of the tragedy in detail.
<Page28>
The main street is wrapped in a red veil.
Little by little, the flames burn away the outline of the buildings as if they're being cut by a blade.
<Page29>
It is a river of fire. Within it is a man ceaselessly consuming. He bathes himself in the crimson rain, showing off his appetite being satisfied.
There are several people in front of the man.
They are police officers that were setting up a barricade.
The officers raise their pistols and fire in unison.
<Page30>
"―――Wha―――"
However, the man does not budge.
Even though they are cops, the man doesn't even notice them.
More figures appear from behind Vlov.
<Page31>
Burning Corpses.
Perhaps they are people who were alive just a few minutes ago, but now they have become moving corpses.
As if they were begging for help...
the corpses move towards the firing officers―――
<Page32>
"―――What the hell―――is this―――"
I feel a white flame burning in my throat.
I didn't even have the chance to look away.
The sense of duty and urgency I had while running towards the city have been wiped clean.
Right now, the only thing left in my mind is pure awe.
<Page33>
That's a vampire's true nature.
A thing that simply kills people just by existing.
And now it is an enemy that we must defeat no matter what―――
<Page34>
"...There's no sign of them. Those guys from the church.
If they really were so adamant about hunting vampires, they would have been here by now... I guess they're not in this country after all.
But that doesn't explain the unusually strict control of traffic... Perhaps the Executors are in plain uniform instead of their usual battle gear."
<Page35>
Arcueid is not looking at the river of fire.
Instead, she's focusing her attention on something completely different.
<Page36>
"So what's the plan, Shiki?
As you can see, this is Vlov's true nature. He's a mass murderer that had no intention of finding me in the first place."
<Page37>
"If we leave him be, he'll eventually run out of blood and become weak.
The scale of Vlov's attack means that this city will probably burn to the ground, but after that, I can defeat him alone.
Will you be watching from the sidelines? Or―――"
<Page38>
She asks whether I'm willing to risk my life to save others.
Although she already knows what I'm about to say, Arcueid confirms it one final time.
And so, with all the determination I can muster, I glare at her, my body shuddering.
<Page39>
"...Hah, it seems that I can't make you change your mind.
To think that you'd still fight after seeing that. Perhaps I was wrong about the both of you.
But what are you going to do?
In this condition, I don't mind beginning right now."
<Page40>
Begin right now...?
You're going to move the battlefield... no, you mean you're going to change the area!? // re-check. looks right compared to the japanese but could be re-worded.
<Page41>
"Is there anything you can do about this situation!?"
"Yes, if all things go well. I don't want to attract any attention either."
"I beg you...! Please go in and fight him right now...!"
<Page42>
"Understood. Then I'll drop all of them underground.
There seems to be some kind of hollow space underneath."
<Page43>
...Wait. She's going to drop them... underground?
No, this is no time to be asking questions.
Right now, we need to get them off the street as fast as possible...!
<Page44>
"But don't forget our promise. Make sure you find me afterward."
<Page45>
I was so amazed that I couldn't keep up with my thoughts at all.
That's outrageous―――
Leaving me behind, Arcueid leaps off from the rooftop and into the void.
<Page46>
She's like a white flower, dancing in the wind.
<Page47>
A swirl of air catches her body as she throws herself from the rooftop.
The chains of gravity are broken,
the anchors of attraction are hoisted,
and the thing that should have fallen, rises gently instead.
Like a sailing ship catching the wind, she frolics around in the night sky.
<Page48>
There's nothing to be surprised about.
That incarnation is a projection of a child from another planet.
All the fluctuations that occur on the surface belong to her.
<Page49>
The blessings of nature that give way to life,
the wrath of nature that takes it away,
the naturally endowed rights of that body.
<Page50>
"Okay―――"
The beautiful flower turns itself to look at the moon.
Her consciousness turns from the sky to the ground.
The unraveled chains and the hoisted anchors strike the surface of the Earth.
Below her is a tall, stone building scattering fire.
"―――Let's do this!"
<Page51>
The blooming flower in the night sky turns into a falling star.
The flower of the moon transforms itself into a tempest, blowing away the burning blaze.
