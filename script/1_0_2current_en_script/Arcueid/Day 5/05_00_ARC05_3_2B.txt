"Okay, let's take a short break.
You must be hungry, right Shiki? Do you want some more of that? Or should I make you another meal?"
<Page2>
"―――#No, I'll make it myself.
I'll just use the ingredients in the fridge as I please."
<Page3>
I don't usually judge a dish at first glance, but I didn't have the guts to eat a dish like that, which made use of just the flavor of the raw ingredients.
For a moment, I thought that I could do it if I was in perfect condition... but I was wrong.
Although the danger of Vlov cannot be avoided, I should avoid this danger at the very least.
<Page4>
After finishing a quick meal, I resume my conversation with Arcueid.
At any rate, we've decided on a course of action. All that remains is to formulate a strategy.
The problem is that flame.# As long as we don't do something about it, neither I nor Arcueid can get close to him.
<Page5>
"...I guess a surprise attack is our only option.
It did seem like you were his target. So we should have you act as a decoy and lure him out.
Meanwhile, I'll hide in advance and attack him from behind during the window where he heads towards you... or something like that."
<Page6>
It's a pretty rough plan, but it's the only one I can think of right now.
The only question that remains is how do I get close to him within those flames...
<Page7>
"Yeah. I think a plan like that should work.
I'll be the decoy, and you'll be the attacker. If it's you, then the question of how much life Vlov has reserved becomes irrelevant."
<Page8>
"...There are other problems as well.
Leaving me aside, you're the one that has to fight that guy head-on. What are you going to do about those flaming hands?"
<Page9>
"Hm? That shouldn't be a problem.
After taking that hit, I figured that Vlov's flame was somewhere around 3000 <C|o   >. So I'll be able to endure if I rebuild my body to become heat resistant from now on."
<Page10>
"Huh...?"
No, isn't it weird to say a number like 3000 <C|o   > so casually?
Wouldn't that kind of temperature be enough to melt even a rock?
<Page11>
"The surrounding flames are much easier to handle.
Those things are only a mild contamination on the ground surface, so when you come out of the shadows, I'll give off a little scream and blow it away.
Although I couldn't do it back in the hotel since you were behind me."
<Page12>
...A scream, huh.
It does feel like a considerably easy way to win, but the fact is that she saved my life at that time.
<Page13>
"Yup, that pretty much settles it.
First, I'll become the bait and lure out Vlov. Meanwhile, you will find somewhere to hide.
Then, when Vlov appears, we'll fight for a little bit.
I won't be able to defeat Vlov with my strength tonight, but I can at least put out the flames around him and hinder his movement."
<Page14>
"What exactly do you mean by hindering his movement? Don't tell me that you're going to seize him and hold him down from above... are you?"
<Page15>
"I'm not going to do anything that uncivilized.
It would be futile to hold him down directly. Besides, I've never done it before. Not to mention that it wouldn't be necessary."
<Page16>
"I-I see. In that case, how are you going to pin Vlov down?"
"It depends on the location, but essentially I'll be using chains."
<Page17>
"Chains...? By chains, you mean those chains?"
"Yeah. You know, something like this."
"!?"#W-What's this, my hands are bound by chains all of a sudden...!?
Before that, where did these chains even come from!?
<Page18>
"This is a manifestation formed by the elements in the air. For me, this shape is easy to visualize and is very compatible.# As for its strength... Hmm, in this case, a single strand can withstand around a hundred tons or so. In any case, I'll pile dozens of them, so I can seal his movement at the very least."
<Page19>
"I'll mainly restrain his limbs and leave some space on his head and torso, so all you have to do is cut his line of death on his body."
<Page20>
"...O-Okay, I get it. I get it, so please untie me. It's coming off. My hands will get torn off, before I even face Vlov."
<Page21>
The chains that suddenly appeared become thinner and vanish like it was melting into the air.
...Once again, I come to realize the sheer outrageousness that is Arcueid.
<Page22>
But it's clear that if she can create those 'chains' at will, then we'll be able to restrain Vlov for a short period of time.
<Page23>
"...Well, anyways!
I'll bind Vlov's limbs with those chains if I see an opening during our fight.
I can prevent his movements for around 10 seconds, so you will have to come out of hiding during that time and cut his line from the front as quickly as possible.
Don't worry. With skill like yours, he'll be dead in no time."
<Page24>
".....What do you mean 'from the front'....." 
Arcueid says it like there was nothing wrong, but I still end up feeling worried.
<Page25>
"No, let's not make any assumptions about things we have no experience of.
On second thought, I'll find some way to get close from behind and cut the 'lines' on his limbs. If I do that, I can take away his freedom for the time being―――"
<Page26>
Then there is no need for Arcueid to 'fight' him.
The choice to fight can be made only if my surprise attack fails.
With that in mind, I look at Arcueid's face―――
<Page27>
"―――Shiki. In that case, you would die."
"Eh―――?"
<Page28>
"This is not a matter of how to do things safely.
We're not talking about how to avoid death, we're talking about how to kill."
<Page29>
"Well that's―――true I guess."
"You're going against a vampire from now on.
That's why you must throw away your sense of morality, even if it's just for tonight. Carrying around that burden will only weigh you down when the time comes."
<Page30>
"...I know that much. Our opponent is a monster after all, which is why I'm willing to help."
<Page31>
"No, you don't understand at all, Shiki.
Cutting off a limb? You should give up on such a suicidal act. If you have time to cut off his limbs, then you should start by cutting away his life force. It'd be different if you were any other creature, but this is something only you can do.
Listen. Don't give Vlov a chance to fight back. The only advantage you have is that he doesn't know about your true form."
<Page32>
Arcueid's eyes give me no room to deny her.
...Her red pupils assert to me.
'If you miss your first shot, you won't have another chance.'
<Page33>
...She's right.
It's just like she said. While I leisurely waste away my time cutting off his limbs, my body will be burned to a crisp―――
<Page34>
"Vlov will show himself when it turns to night.
When that time comes, we―――no, you and I are going to kill him the only way we know-how.
It's not about how do we survive.
It's about how do we 'kill' him, and nothing more."
<Page35>
Arcueid gazes straight at me with her deadly eyes.
...She is really angry.
She's angry at the fact that there is still a place in me where I keep such naive thoughts.
<Page36>
"―――Fine. I won't hold back.
I'll cut all of his lines in one go.
That should be fine, right Arcueid?"
<Page37>
"........"
Arcueid's gaze remains stern.
...The fact that she doesn't reply with anything suggests that she's at least satisfied with my answer.
<Page38>
"But where should I wait for him?
This apartment is no different than the hotel. If there is some place with very few people where I can hide..."//word used マンション but they're refering to Arc's apartment complex
<Page39>
"The best place to go to is the central park in this city. It does become deserted at night after all.# .....But if there happen to be people passing by, it would be purely because they were out of luck."
<Page40>
Arcueid turns her back and averts her gaze from me.
"...What? If you have something to say, then say it."
<Page41>
"You can't do it. After all, you never said the word 'kill' even once.
At this rate, you will definitely hesitate at the very last moment. And then you'll be killed before you know it."
<Page42>
"...As if that would happen. That guy is a monster that killed over a hundred people. There's no way that I would ever hesitate in killing that man."
"―――――――"
Arcueid breathes a tiny sigh.
<Page43>
"...I could take Vlov down with certainty if I just enchant you with my Mystic Eyes. I'm not sure why, but even though this is the first time I've felt this before, I've never been so disgusted with myself in my life.
It's like some sort of contradiction."
<Page44>
"I'll believe in you, Shiki. Let's go and defeat Vlov together."
Reverting back from her gloomy voice, Arcueid turns around in a cheerful tone.
<Page45>
...I wonder why.
Even though her eyes were filled with trust, I can't help but feel extremely uneasy towards that smile of hers.
