<Page1>
She was just like a human missile.
Arcueid descended from a height of 80 meters above Vlov.
<Page2>
No, it was more like she flew.
While in the air, she took aim and angled herself before accelerating like a missile.
<Page3>
Earth and debris billow up into the air.
The wind whipped up a cloud of dust that scoured the area.
The river of flame that had been flowing over the downtown area was halted by that single blow.
<Page4>
The blast blows away the policemen that had been encircling Vlov, incapacitating most of them in the process. Half of them have been knocked unconscious by blows to the head, and the rest have simply lost their will to fight.
It's not surprising.
<Page5>
"In-Incre..."
Once the dust has settled, the extent of the destruction is plain to see. // これである reified for flow
Arcueid's rapid descent not only shattered the area around Vlov, but also collapsed a significant portion of the business district around the north gate.
<Page6>
So that's what she meant by 'dropping them underground'.
The land has sunk over 40 meters.
<Page7>
It felt like watching an incredible force of nature. Its grandeur is on the same level as the Amazon jungle or Niagara Falls.
"Cut me some slack, you idiot――――!"
Of course, I'm not praising her in the slightest.
<Page8>
"But damn, that was cool. Was that by accident, or was it part of her plan!?"
There aren't any casualties as best I can tell from the rooftop.
The policemen who were outside the blast radius have tended to the knocked-out officers and withdrawn from the site of the explosion.
<Page9>
As a result, this entire area is now completely deserted.
This――― this method of clearing out people is way too over the top...!
<Page10>
"......!"
Did that flame come from Vlov?
Whether Arcueid missed or Vlov dodged the attack, either way, he is still alive.
<Page11>
...A monster that doesn't go down even from a strike like that.
As if hunting him down,
a white shadow challenges the flame's source in the cloud of dust.
<Page12>
'Make sure you follow after me―――'// Reference to 05_00_ARC05_5.txt:158
Arcueid's words resurface in my mind.
...I'll think about that stuff later.
Right now, I need to hurry down to the ground...!
<Page13>
"Hah, hah, hah, ha―――!"
I run over to the stairs.// This is 階段を駆け下りる, but it comes _before_ he cuts the lock / runs down them on the next page
I cut the lock on the door to the rooftop with my knife.
<Page14>
"...Hah, hah, ha―――ah."
I run down the stairs, relying on the emergency lights.
...My resolve, like my breathing, becomes more and more ragged as I go.//覚悟していた筈の気持ちは、荒れる息づかいと共に乱れていく。
<Page15>
All I have to do is cut through Vlov's 'lines'.
First, Arcueid will battle him and then restrain him with her chains.
After that it's my turn.
I'll sprint up to him, cut his lines and dismantle his body.
<Page16>
Arcueid's plunge back then was extraordinary.
So I believe it's definitely possible that Vlov can be pinned down.
However―――
<Page17>
"―――But, even so―――"
...Even so, Vlov is in good condition.
Is Arcueid's assessment still accurate?
On the off-chance she's wrong, she will be handicapped by her wound.
<Page18>
...In the worst-case scenario, I would have to fight Vlov alone―――
No, that won't happen.
We didn't make any plans for the worst-case scenario. It's not that we didn't think about it, there is just no reason to.
<Page19>
That's because if Arcueid were to be defeated by Vlov, the only choice I would have left is to run away.
<Page20>
"Hah――――――hah."
I reach the elevator.
I head inside and press the button for the first floor.
There's no more time for hesitation.
There was never any time to hesitate in the first place.
I take a deep breath. I give my body a once-over. I can move properly at the very least.
<Page21>
Only the fingers holding the knife are frozen in place, as if they don't even belong to me.
<Page22>
"――――――"
Could this be fear?
Am I afraid of confronting the violence... of confronting that monster?
If that's the case, then it's fine.
It's normal for people to be afraid of that thing. Of facing someone that could kill you just by drawing near. How can you call yourself human if you aren't afraid of that?
<Page23>
That's why,
if there is a problem, it would be―――
<Page24>
"――――――"
...It would be if,
more than being afraid of being killed, I were to be afraid of killing.//This sentence fully expanded would be 問題があるとしたら、それは、殺される事より、殺す事を、怖がっている場合だけ。
<Page25>
"Ha―――――h."
My breathing speeds up.
My heart is pounding restlessly like it's detached from my body entirely.
<Page26>
...I reach the first floor.
I adjust my grip on the knife and run towards the newly formed crater.
