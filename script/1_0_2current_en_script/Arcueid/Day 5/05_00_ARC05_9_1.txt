<Page1>
It has to be throwing.
No, more like a bullet.
Even if his guard is up now, it doesn't change the fact that I am a lethal weapon to him.
<Page2>
Now it's just a matter of how to shoot it.
It's simple. If I can't get over there with my legs, I'll have to rely on something else...!
<Page3>
I run back towards Arcueid.//Same as 05_00_ARC05_9_3.txt
"Shiki―――!"
I hear the sound of ice being smashed behind me.
The claw-shaped wind pressure generated by Arcueid seems to be accurate not just within her reach, but even at this distance.
<Page4>
"Geez, why did you come over here?! You'll just turn us into a single target!"
<Page5>
It's more favorable for Vlov to have his prey grouped up.
Even I know that.
<Page6>
"I know, but this is the only way!
You tossed that debris just now, right?!
I need you to do the same thing with me!"
"Huh?!"
<Page7>
Or to be more precise, 'I need you to throw me'.
The debris from earlier was a chunk of floor that was almost three meters long.
If she can throw something like that at such a speed, I can get there many times faster than if I were to run!
<Page8>
"I kind of understand what you're trying to say!
But won't you get knocked away en route?!"
"Normally, yes! But you can send out as many of those binding things as you want, right?!"
"―――Well, yeah I can."
<Page9>
Arcueid is hesitant, but right now there is no other choice.
I'll get her to bind me onto a piece of rubble big enough for me to hide behind and then throw it towards Vlov.
Naturally, I would get shot down if I was aimed directly at him.
So if possible, she should throw three pieces of debris.
<Page10>
The first shot should be aimed directly at Vlov,
the second shot should deliberately miss and land behind Vlov,
and the third shot should be aimed at Vlov again.
<Page11>
The second shot is the one I'll be hiding behind.
Just before it hits the ground, I'll cut the 'lines' running through the rubble to break it apart and take Vlov from behind in under 2 seconds...!//地面に落下する直前、瓦礫に走る『線』を斬って解体し、２秒以内にヴローヴの背後をとってやる……！
<Page12>
"Are you sure you wanna do that?
If we miss the timing, your corpse is gonna end up smeared across the ground!"//Liberal tl of 衝突死体 - タイミング逃したら衝突死体よ
"That's only if we miss. If things go smoothly, we can kill him without getting hurt. This is the only way."
<Page13>
The barrage of ice spears grows in intensity.
We can't waste any more time here.
<Page14>
"―――I got it. So while I'm aiming for Vlov, I need to miss him with the one piece of debris that you're riding on, right?"//ヴローヴを狙いながら、志貴の乗った瓦礫だけ外すのね？
"Yeah. I just need to pass him on the side."
<Page15>
I go around behind Arcueid.
I flatten myself against a large piece of debris. I put my body against the rock surface and arrange myself into a push-up position.//大きめの瓦礫に身を寄せる。岩肌に体をつけ、腕立て伏せの状態になる。
<Page16>
Green ivy emerges from Arcueid's fingertips and ties me to the debris.
Both of my thighs and my left hand are pinned to it. The only thing left free is my right hand holding the knife.
<Page17>
"Based on the one I threw earlier...//Sentence restructured across this and next - ヴローヴまで50メートル、
it feels like about 50 meters to Vlov."//さっきのがあんな感じだったから―――
<Page18>
With two hands, Arcueid lifts up both a chunk of decoy rubble and the piece of rubble that I'm hiding behind.
"Yeah, hold on for four seconds!!"
<Page19>
One ton of bedrock flies through the air.
Three seconds later.
As though overwhelming the attempts of air resistance to slow it down through sheer power, the first throw hurtles towards Vlov's head,//　空気抵抗による失速を力でねじ伏せるように、一投目はヴローヴの頭部に飛来し、
and just before impact is shattered by the ice lance.//命中する直前、氷槍によって砕け散った。
<Page20>
However, it's not as though it was in vain.//とはいえ無為に終わった訳ではない。
Though the rubble was shattered, some fraction of the splintered fragments score direct hits on Vlov's body.//瓦礫は砕かれたものの、その破片の何割かはヴローヴの体に直撃した。
Despite not dealing damage, they at least chip away at his consciousness.
<Page21>
In that opening, the debris carrying me passes right by him.//その隙に、俺を乗せた瓦礫はヤツの真横を通り過ぎた。
<Page22>
I dismantle the debris.
Inertia comes to a stop.
My limbs are freed.
I stick to the ground like a lizard.
My body temperature and blood freeze instantly.
<Page23>
"―――Hah."
I can see Vlov's back.
The distance is four meters. It will be close, but it's not impossible. // ギリギリだが不可能ではない。
<Page24>
Arcueid's third throw holds him in position.
One second passes. One meter to go.
In two more steps, I'll be able to reach his 'line' and sever his life.
<Page25>
However.
It is impossible for a human to cross those two steps.
<Page26>
"――――――"
My ability to scream,//悲鳴をあげるだけの余裕も、
and my capacity to feel pain were already frozen solid.//苦痛を感じるだけの感覚も、既に凍っていた。
Did he notice me, or was it simply an autonomic counterattack?
A countless number of ice thorns had sprouted around Vlov to greet any would-be attacker.
<Page27>
"―――As the fool you are, you chose the path of safety."
A voice of disappointment reaches me.
Safety. Safety. Safety, huh.
I was thinking about a way to save myself.
Out of concern for me, Arcueid threw my debris a second slower compared to the other ones.
...This was a failure. This was beyond foolish of me.
This was nowhere close to a surprise attack.
<Page28>
There is no need to wait until I bleed to death.
My suffering from being afflicted by Vlov's cold wave, combined with my own disappointment in myself, has brought my heart to a complete stop.//罹 seems a little disease-y ヴローヴに罹った寒波と、己への失望から、俺の心臓は完全に停止していた。
