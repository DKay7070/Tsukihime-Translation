It has to be gliding.//Sliding -> falling makes no sense, but gliding -> falling does 滑走だ。
No, the correct term is closer to falling.
...But can I do it? It's up to fate whether I'll make it there or not.
<Page2>
It's not safe by any stretch of the imagination. Even if everything goes well, the impact of the landing will tear my muscles and break my bones.
Will I really be able to endure that pain?
<Page3>
I stop the projectiles that prick at my indecisiveness in the nick of time.//俺の 迷いを 突くかのような 弾丸を 寸前で 止める。
That was close. Thank goodness.
With that, my mind is made up.//Thanks to that feels a bit J->E? Also duplicative of above おかげでこっちも覚悟が決まった。
I just need to bear the burden. From the beginning, I have always been insensitive to the pain of death.//もとより、死の痛みには鈍い性質だ。
Just as he does, I, too, will kill without a second thought.//ヤツがそうであるように、俺も、一秒<違|たが>わず“殺す”事だけを考察してやる。
<Page4>
I turn around and run back towards Arcueid.
My energy is completely drained from the excessive movement.
I can't take even one more step forward.
The enemy I must approach is a distant 50 meters away.//Over yonder for 彼方 feels a bit out of character 近づくべき敵は50メートル先の彼方だ。
<Page5>
It doesn't matter.
In any case, the horizontal distance has no bearing on my choice.//ruby dots <横|・><軸|・><の|・><距|・><離|・>
<Page6>
"Arcueid, can you do that thing again from earlier?!"
"What do you mean by 'that thing'?!"
<Page7>
I tell Arcueid what I intend to do.//アルクェイドにこちらの意図を伝える。
The explanation ends with a single word.
After a moment of bewilderment, Arcueid looks at my face and agrees as if she has no choice.
<Page8>
If we do it on that scale, it will consume the last of my remaining strength.//「……その規模でやるとわたしの余力もなくなるわ。
Knowing that, do you still want to do it? Escape will no longer be a possibility."//それでもいいのね？　もう逃げる事もできないわよ？」
<Page9>
It doesn't matter. I nod.//かまわない、と頷く。
I don't even have the strength to speak. Also hold on, has she been looking for an opportunity like this the entire time?!
<Page10>
"Huh? But wouldn't that mean you'll fall down halfway?
I can't really do anything about that."
"Of course I'm going to fall! That's why―――"
<Page11>
Even though I wanted to bring my breathing under control a little, I end up lecturing her in a loud voice.
And over there―――
<Page12>
"―――!"
There's no time to explain.
A barrage of ice spears bears down on us. Vlov plans to mercilessly skewer Arcueid through me.
<Page13>
"Just do it, there's no need to hold back! I don't care if you overdo it! If you end up killing me, then so be it!"//おまえに殺されるなら、それはそれで本望だ！
<Page14>
There's no time for pretense.
I take my gaze off Arcueid and stare at the enemy in the distance.
The woman behind me, as though responding to my order, says―――
<Page15>
"Yeah, leave it to me! I'll make sure that you win, Shiki!"
