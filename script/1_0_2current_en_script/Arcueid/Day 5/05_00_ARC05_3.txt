"I see. In that case, I won't say anything.
I'm glad that you've decided to fight by my side. After all, we can easily 'kill' Vlov in one blow with you around."
<Page2>
"...No, surely that's not possible.
He gives off so much heat that I can't even get close to him.
And besides, how are we going to find him in the first place?"
<Page3>
"Find him... you really are extreme, aren't you? To think that you would go on the offensive right after choosing not to run away."
"H-Hey, I was just thinking out loud! I don't want to hear that from the personification of extremes herself."
<Page4>
"I'm just more focused on efficiency.
...Well, whatever. Just so you know, it's going to be a war of attrition from here on out.
The safest strategy until my strength returns to normal is to run.
After three days, my <strength|L i f e  S c a l e    > will be restored to about 30% of its original level. With that much power, I'll be able to defeat Vlov on my own."
<Page5>
"Three days...? But then..."
"Yeah. During those three days, Vlov will be on the loose. He will go underground and use humans to replenish his blood supply... no, that's not all. From the looks of it, he might even go out and roam the streets at night.
He's not in his right mind after all. Maybe he doesn't understand that the church will go after him if he doesn't hide his presence."
<Page6>
"I can't allow that. That guy is a monster that leaves a trail of flames anywhere he goes! How can we ignore him for even a single day!?"
<Page7>
"Then we have no choice but to find and kill Vlov during the day.
But I'm against it. I have a rough idea of where he is, but there's nothing more cautious than a Dead Apostle in slumber. There's a high chance that we'll get killed instead if we go after him as we are."
<Page8>
"No way. You have a good idea of where he is, but you're just going to let him go...?"
"Yeah. I told you before, no matter how many humans fall prey to Vlov, it's none of my concern."
<Page9>
...I'm speechless.
I understand where Arcueid is coming from.
There's gotta be some way to increase our odds... no, if I want to be certain, I should wait for Arcueid to recover from her wounds and regain her strength.
<Page10>
...But it's a tradeoff; the more time that we waste here, the more victims there will be.
I should――――
C:> ...Search for Vlov right away.
C:> ...Stay here until nightfall, at least.
