<Page1>
His chest is pierced.
A great deal of blood is spilled.
The plug that held in Vlov's blood has been removed.//Literally <血の浴槽|ブラッドバス> but does feel awkward to tl that literally
<Page2>
The burning <delusion|d r e a m    > comes to an end.
The final boundary is crossed.
And then,
with an earth-rending scream, the vampire's true form is revealed.
<Page3>
The atmosphere creaks.
The frenetic dance of atoms is abruptly brought to a crawl.//I _think_ he's talking thermodynamics here - the heat is drained from the area, and so the kinetic energy of the atoms is reduced. TL adapted a bit under that assumption. 原子の活動が早きから遅きに切り替わる。
Electrons, repelled by the solidified rift of near-absolute zero temperatures, have nowhere to go and start to react.//凝固した超低温の断層に弾かれて、行き場を失った電子が反応する。
<Page4>
The blue flames that blanketed the ground were not flames at all.
Similar to the enthalpy of vaporization, they were more like heat that had been lost from the earth itself.//あれは気化熱に似た、大地から失われる熱のようなもの。
<Page5>
"―――Ah, it's true."
A cold-blooded arm hangs in the air.
The palm of his hand is outstretched, as if groping for warmth.
<Page6>
"―――This <place|w o r l d   > is cold."
The white beauty in front of him is swallowed completely.
<Page7>
"――――――, Eh?"
More than just a drop in temperature, it was like the world itself had changed without warning.
<Page8>
The river of ice that sprung forth from Vlov didn't just blow away Arcueid, it kept extending all the way to the city behind her.
<Page9>
It took less than two seconds.
The glacier reached the buildings on the surface and froze everything in an instant.
...What if.
If there were people in that building who hadn't yet evacuated, every single one of them would have had their heat stolen. // あらゆる熱を停止させた。This line is so weird but I decided to mostly keep it as is because it's shiki sort of unable to accept
<Page10>
My body trembles at the unbelievable scene in front of me.
I'm terrified at the prospect of what might happen next.
It's only by chance that I'm still alive.//ruby dots <た|・><ま|・><た|・><ま|・>
If I had been behind Arcueid, I would've been frozen where I stood.
<Page11>
The expanding river of flames was a slow-moving disaster.
People could run away faster than the fire was able to spread.
But that glacier formed in an instant.
Its range is narrow, and the cold wave only crawls on the ground, but once it's released there would be no chance of escaping it.
<Page12>
If that guy manages to get above ground, anyone that comes face to face with him would have no choice but to lay down and die.
<Page13>
"―――Arcueid.
That's right, where's Arcueid...!?"
<Page14>
I hang on to my one and only hope.
She's the only one who can stop that monster.
<Page15>
"There she is...!"
In the middle of the icy river stands the figure of Arcueid.
Thank goodness... That girl really is tough as well.
She's standing amidst that algid air without a scratch on her...!
<Page16>
"...So that's how it is.
It's not that you've lost your sanity, you're just running away from it."
<Page17>
"Even a third-rate Dead Apostle can defeat a planet as long as he has a Principle, huh.//to be rechecked, We may want to translate 星 as planet
Thanks to that, I'm wide awake now, Vlov Arkhangel."
<Page18>
Arcueid brushes off the glacier.
Vlov stares at her with cold eyes.
Not with the sickly eyes from before, but with eyes that carefully observe their prey like a hunter in a snowfield.
<Page19>
"...I'm the one who should say such things.
How dare you take so much warmth from me."
<Page20>
His voice was like a blade, filled with nothing but hatred.
The vampire's fighting spirit has not faded.
...No.
To be more precise, it's like he is actually ready to fight for the first time.
<Page21>
"I see. Then accept your good fortune, Vlov. Normally, I would have finished you before you woke up. But your life was saved by a despicable murderer. Well, for a short time at least."
<Page22>
"―――Indeed.
You're quite different in person from what I had been led to expect.//伝え聞いた貴様の姿と、今の貴様はかけ離れている。
...It appears that in this moment of truth, fortune smiles upon me."
<Page23>
"I hate to say it, but you're right.
It seems that both of us only have one final attack remaining. Whichever of us attacks, the other will disappear.
But before that, allow me to extend to you at least this courtesy."
<Page24>
"―――Answer me livestock, puny vassal of mine.
Testimony of the Ancestor. Lesion of the Root. Hollow like a grand vortex.//祖の<証|あかし>。<根|ね>の病巣。大渦の如きその穴蔵。
Descendant carrying new Principle.
What doth blood mean to thee?"
<Page25>
It was a stern voice, jarringly out of place in the current situation.
Arcueid's question could be taken as a reprimand.
After opening his eyes wide in surprise, Vlov replies.
<Page26>
"―――Allow me to respond with respect.
For me, blood is the very essence of warmth.
The heat of life. The elixir to cure my frostbite. My world revolves around it, as does my Principle.//Blood's what makes his world go round, phrasing I chose here is a bit less literal but I think translates better to both subjects. 我が世界、我が原理を回すもの。
Indeed. Without blood, I would freeze to death in this blistering cold."
The man reveals his true colors in a voice that could be described as respectful.
<Page27>
"...I remember now.
A freak who hated and feared humans, who drifted across distant seas and built a castle to avoid them.//人間を嫌い、恐れ、避けようと絶海を漂流し、城を構えた変わりもの。
One of the Twenty-Seven Ancestors, Zaria Offenbaum.
I'd heard that despite ruling over a territory while in posession of a millenium surpassing Principle, she never produced any 'children', but...... I see.
In other words, you killed her and took it, didn't you?"//ruby dots <殺|・><し|・><て|・><奪|・><っ|・><た|・><の|・><ね|・>
<Page28>
"...That's right. I am not a successor, I am simply a knight. Or rather, I was. Eternity and other such concepts are well beyond my comprehension."
<Page29>
The vampire turns his right hand toward his own shadow.
From the long―― unnaturally long―― shadow that stretches before him emerges the hulking form of an outlandish weapon.//得物 seems a bit more ~special~ than just weapon. Ruby dots <得|・><物|・>
<Page30>
"However, she was utterly undeserving of the position of family head.//だが、ご当主にとっても、ソレはより不相応だった。
Therefore I took it. As a knight, I defeated the Queen and usurped her throne. And now this Principle is a curse that belongs to me alone."
"I see. It must have been a short reign."
<Page31>
"...Well, aren't you an arrogant one? You are so weak that you cannot even use a Marble Phantasm, and yet you decide to face me head-on?"
"It doesn't matter. There is no need to materialize a world against a mere Dead Apostle.
Against someone like you――― these claws are more than enough."
"――――――"
<Page32>
The edges of the vampire's mouth twist upwards.
His refined face warps into that of an ugly beast.//成り下がる
It's as though he were grinning in agreement with Arcueid's provocation.//アルクェイドの挑発を、その通りだ、と<嗤|わら>うように。
<Page33>
"The strongest ones are those who continue to adapt and do not remain locked in their ways.//最も強きものとは千変にして偏|かたよ>らぬもの
...You are exactly that. Even diminished as you are, your remaining power still surpasses my own.//そこまで衰退していながら、まだおれを上回る余力がある。
A primordial one that deals with every curse and every situation――― No ordinary Dead Apostle can possibly compare."
<Page34>
The atmosphere distorts.//空気が歪む
The blue fever of ill thoughts lowers the temperature in the crater.//病想の青い熱が、地下の気温を下げていく。
<Page35>
Arcueid doesn't hesitate.
She charges Vlov head-on, despite knowing that his strange weapon has the potential to defeat her.
―――And then.
<Page36>
"But you do not understand.
Although that territory is a part of this planet, it is an isolated biosphere in which life cannot exist.//I think this か is an inanimate reference here? <彼|か>の領土はこの星の一部でありながら、“生きるに<能|あた>わず”と除外された生命圏。
Even a Princess of the True Ancestors like yourself cannot possibly endure a hell like this...!"
<Page37>
A wave of cold air spreads around Vlov.
Arcueid comes to a sudden halt and sticks her hands out in a protective gesture.
The wind blows fiercely, and with a piercing howl envelops the city in absolute zero.//吹き<荒|すさ>び、金切り声をあげ、街を覆う絶対零度。
And then.
<Page38>
A huge lance of otherworldly steel pulverizes her pure white dress.
<Page39>
...The blizzard blocks my field of vision.
My breath comes out white.
<Page40>
Arcueid is blown dozens of meters back and collapses on top of the wreckage.
The dress that had been repelling the flames is shattered.
She reverts to her former self.
<Page41>
"...You monster. To think that you still remain intact after a blow from my lance.
However―――"
<Page42>
Arcueid doesn't stir from where she collapsed.
Without moving from where he stands, Vlov holds up his right hand as if to signal something.//ヴローヴは一歩も動かないまま、何かの合図を送るように右手をかかげた。
The rubble around him crumbles.
Several corpses crawl out from underground, groaning.
<Page43>
"The spoils of this hunt now belong to me.//この狩りは、もはやおれのものだ
Go forth and pick up that woman's corpse.
That adaptability. That all-powerful blood which transcends all anguish, bring it to me."
<Page44>
At Vlov's command, the corpses begin walking over to Arcueid.
<Page45>
The winner has been decided.
Our strategy has failed.
Vlov cannot be sealed by those chains anymore.
Arcueid has been defeated, and the city engulfed by a freezing wave.//アルクェイドは敗れ、街は寒波に包まれた。
Everything around me has been annihilated.//なにもかもが死に絶えたのだ。
I stand right in front of it all, watching the final scene unfold before my eyes―――
