<Page1>
I can't go down like this.
The ground below is completely filled with blue flames.
<Page2>
A tall vampire stands at the center.
Vlov Arkhangel.
He stands in the middle of the crater without a single scratch.
By human standards, he's basically an immortal monster.
And then...
<Page3>
There is a white figure trifling with the man from the front.
The beautiful hunter runs through the garden of flickering flames and debris.
<Page4>
Of course, that white figure belongs to Arcueid.
She leaps across the river of flames and closes in on Vlov.
<Page5>
A crude and deadly weapon is gripped in Vlov's hand.
Although it has the appearance of a long sword, the blade is that of a billhook.
Arcueid on the other hand is fighting empty-handed.
Using the force of her legs alone, she closes in on Vlov. And then...
<Page6>
She exchanges blows with Vlov's billhook using just her claws, causing the tall figure to retreat...!
<Page7>
A single wound can be seen on Vlov's arm, it is so deep that the bone underneath is visible.
It was only visible for an instant. The arm that had been sliced open by Arcueid's claw heals thanks to the blood pouring out.
<Page8>
Arcueid said that vampires are immortal and carry a large stock of life as long as they have blood.
It's exactly as she said.
In the blink of an eye, a wound that would have killed a normal creature had instantly become a thing of the past.
<Page9>
The massive weapon is swung without hesitation.
Arcueid keeps her distance.
Whenever she strikes a blow, she moves out of his range and prepares for the next attack.
<Page10>
Is she being cautious of Vlov's counterattack... No, that's not it.
That face... Is she enjoying herself as she is cornering Vlov...?
<Page11>
"Is being tough to kill the only redeeming feature you have?
The quality of the Twenty-Seven Ancestors must have fallen. Are you really going to let me kill you like this without revealing your trump card?"
<Page12>
"―――,―――,―――"
Vlov's breathing becomes erratic.
His morbidly pale face becomes tormented with further painful anguish.
<Page13>
...Vlov is most definitely immortal.
But even that has its limits.
It may seem like he's unharmed, but there's no doubt that Arcueid's rapid dive attack had inflicted a fatal wound, even for him.
<Page14>
It had taken all of his effort to regenerate his body
It's easy to assume that he spent most of his energy trying to revive himself just like when Arcueid was killed by me.
<Page15>
In fact, the same could also be said about Arcueid.
That's the reason why she's keeping her distance after every attack.
She is inviting Vlov to perform one final attack. A counterattack with all his might.
<Page16>
A countless number of clashing sounds echo through the air.
Vlov's breathing becomes frantic.
"―――No, that's―――"
A sense of uneasiness that I cannot describe.
Arcueid has the upper hand. It's clear that Vlov is getting exhausted.
And yet as a bystander, I feel a growing sense of dread in my heart.
<Page17>
The source of the dread is Vlov's increasing invulnerability to Arcueid's claws.
<Page18>
It's also his swordsmanship... No, his skill with that billhook is much greater than one would expect from his appearance.
<Page19>
Furthermore, it's also the fact that he's already able to completely see through Arcueid's speed and movements. And most important of all―――
He still hasn't used that 'flaming hand' of his...!
<Page20>
"GU――――――AAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!"
"―――!"
<Page21>
Vlov lets out a roar.
The flames blaze in response to his mighty roar of rage.
The eternal flames reach a height of several meters,
breaking the river into dozens of branches.
<Page22>
The underground arena turns into a forest of fire.
The wall of flames prevents Arcueid's escape.
And from there,
<Page23>
a hand of unparalleled heat is unleashed towards Arcueid, melting the rubble in its path.
<Page24>
"Arcueid―――!"
In one instant.
The tides of battle get turned in one instant.
<Page25>
Arcueid said that she could withstand temperatures of up to 3000< |o>C.
However, the 'hand' that melted the rubble with ease had a temperature of well over 3000< |o>C.
<Page26>
That combined with the other reasons for that dreadful feeling means that not even ashes will remain. Without an escape path, the flames became a tongue that torment its prey.
The white figure burned away without a trace.
―――That's what would have occurred if this happened last night.
<Page27>
The flames crack open.
A white skirt flutters in the air.
My sight is fixated on the transformation of her outfit as if I had been mesmerized.
<Page28>
I recall her saying something earlier.
'I have a countermeasure. I will recreate my body beforehand.'
<Page29>
The black and white <battle costume|d r e s s   > defies Vlov's flames.
Did it consume those flames, or is her appearance simply the result of her recreated body?
<Page30>
In any case, the flames are unable to affect her now.
Arcueid's countermeasure is flawless.
As soon as she identified that her opponent is a monster of flames, her victory was assured the moment she escaped from the hotel.
<Page31>
A hand of flame is unleashed.
Arcueid casually thrusts out her left hand.
With a motion similar to that of combing her hair, she disperses the towering walls of flames on all sides.
<Page32>
The wall of flames bows its head, submitting itself to the white dress.
Her golden hair shoots back like a shooting star.
<Page33>
The power of the claws that flew and swung down is beyond anything I have ever seen.
As Vlov helplessly retreats, the second and third claws are unleashed.
<Page34>
An overwhelming difference in ability.
It is no longer a battle.
As soon as the flames were nullified, Vlov became nothing but prey to be hunted.
Arcueid's claws are precise and uninterrupted as they continue to inflict fatal wounds on Vlov's body.
<Page35>
The only reason why Vlov is still standing is that he probably still has some blood remaining.
But even that is going to run out at some point. On top of that, there are no humans around from whom to extract resources.
The only blood that remains is that which flows within his own body.
Even that will run out after a few more blows.
<Page36>
In other words, bankruptcy.
If the energy needed to revive his body is lost, his body will rightfully revert back to being a corpse.
<Page37>
"―――Stop, it―――"
He begs for his life without any pretense.
Just like a spoiled child.
His mastery of the billhook is also lost.
The vampire swings his billhook haphazardly as if to shake off the fear in front of him. But Arcueid is not going to let that disgraceful opening pass by.
<Page38>
"It's cold――― It's cold――― This place, is cold―――!"
The vampire jumps as he gives off a scream.
With the last of his blood, Vlov jumps to the back. No, he jumps above.
<Page39>
He jumps from the lower ground and towards the surface.
Even a height of 40 meters is not enough to stop a vampire.
It's likely that he is planning to replenish his blood supply on the surface.
<Page40>
The green ivy tangles around his legs.
The ivy that sprouted from beneath the rubble grows at a terrifying speed, grabbing Vlov's feet and pulling him back into the lower ground.
<Page41>
"A―――AA, AAAA―――!"
A river of flame appears once again at Vlov's feet.
Surrounded by a fire that burns only life, the green ivy gets reduced to ashes.
However, the shackles do not vanish.
New ivy uses the ashes as a nursery and entangles itself with the chains.
<Page42>
No matter how many times they burn, the shackles cannot be removed. They continue to loop like a phoenix.
That's right. If vampires are considered immortal, then the workings of nature are also an eternal, infinite cycle.
<Page43>
That ivy is a manifestation of that. The only way to escape is with a fire that burns this entire planet to the core.
But for Vlov――― No, for a 'curse' of a vampire-like that, Arcueid's breath alone is more than enough to extinguish it.....!
<Page44>
―――Arcueid runs.
From the intensity of her stance, I can tell that this is the final blow.
<Page45>
All of Vlov's counterattacks are destroyed.
With this, she decides that this is the end of the battle.
I reach the same conclusion.
There is no need to wait for my assistance. At this rate, Arcueid will crush Vlov into pieces.
<Page46>
...And yet.
And yet I can't help but feel a bad premonition.
Something is wrong.
His agony and his breathing preach out to me that it is not so.
<Page47>
Vlov's complexion and pain are now morbid.
The world where he is alone is different from inside that scorching heat.
A white breath as if it was from a polar opposite world.
<Page48>
...I know those kinds of eyes.
Obsession and defense mechanisms.
He is both the perpetrator and the victim.
That's why―――
――――――We are definitely making a fatal error.
<Page49>
"You idiot... What the hell am I thinking...!?"
Arcueid's victory is inevitable.
There is no way I am going to interfere at a time like this.
<Page50>
I don't have to do anything.
There's no need for me to go out of my way and enter that hellscape.
Even as I say that, I―――
C:>I'll have to watch the battle from here.
C:>I should stop Arcueid.
