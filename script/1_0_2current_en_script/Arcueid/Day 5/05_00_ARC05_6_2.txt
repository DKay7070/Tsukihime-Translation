<Page1>
I can't go down like this.
The ground below is completely covered by blue flames.
<Page2>
A tall vampire stands at the center.
Vlov Arkhangel.
He was right at the center of that explosion, but there's not a scratch on him.//あの爆撃のただ中にいて、傷一つ負っていない。
By human standards, he's practically an immortal monster.
And then...
<Page3>
There is a white figure toying with the man from the front.
A beautiful huntress darting through the garden of flickering flames and debris.
<Page4>
Of course, that white figure is Arcueid.
She leaps across the river of flames and closes in on Vlov.
<Page5>
He has a crude yet deadly weapon gripped in his hand.
Although it has the appearance of a long sword, the blade is that of a machete.
Arcueid on the other hand is fighting empty-handed.
Using the force of her legs alone, she closes in on Vlov. And then―――
<Page6>
She exchanges blows with Vlov's machete using just her claws, forcing the tall figure to retreat...!
<Page7>
A single gash can be seen on his arm, so deep that the bone within is visible.
It is only there for an instant. The arm sliced open by Arcueid's claws is healed by the very blood that pours forth.
<Page8>
Arcueid had told me that so long as a vampire has blood, they are immortal and possessed of an abundance of life force.
It's exactly as she said.
In the blink of an eye, a wound that would have killed a normal creature had disappeared as though it were never there.
<Page9>
The massive weapon is swung without hesitation.
Arcueid keeps her distance.
After each strike, she moves out of his range and prepares for the next attack.
<Page10>
Is she being cautious of Vlov's counterattack... No, that's not it.
That face... Is she enjoying cornering him...?
<Page11>
"Is being tough to kill the only redeeming feature you have?
The quality of the Twenty-Seven Ancestors has truly fallen. Are you really going to let me kill you like this without revealing your trump card?"
<Page12>
"―――,―――,―――"
Vlov's breathing has become erratic.
His morbidly pale faced is etched with pain and anguish.
<Page13>
...Vlov is most definitely immortal.
But even that has its limits.
It may seem like he's unharmed, but there's no doubt that Arcueid's dive bombing had inflicted a fatal wound, even for him.
<Page14>
Perhaps regenerating his body is all he can manage right now.//This is conjecture on Shiki's part, feels like it ought to have qualifier, but there isn't one in the source 体は再生したものの、それが精一杯。
It's easy to assume that he spent most of his energy on reviving himself, just as Arcueid did when was killed by me.
<Page15>
In fact, Arcueid seems to have come to the same conclusion.//事実、アルクェイドもそう見ている
That's the reason why she's keeping her distance after every attack.
She is inviting Vlov to perform one final attack. A counterattack with all his might.
<Page16>
Countless clashing sounds echo through the air.
Vlov's breathing grows even more frantic.
"―――No, that's―――"
A sense of unease that I can't put into words.
Arcueid has the upper hand. It's clear that Vlov is getting exhausted.
And yet as a bystander, I feel a growing sense of dread in my heart.
<Page17>
The dread stems from the fact that Vlov is taking far fewer hits from Arcueid's claws than he was a little while ago.//それは、ヴローヴが先ほどからアルクェイドの爪を受けなくなりつつある状況であり、
<Page18>
His swordsmanship... or rather, machetemanship, is also much more formidable than one would expect given his appearance.//Made up word but kinda matches the joke better ヤツの剣さばき……いや、鉈さばきは...
<Page19>
On top of that, it's clear that he's already able to see right through Arcueid's speed and movements. But most importantly of all―――
He still hasn't used that 'flaming hand' of his...!
<Page20>
"GU――――――AAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!"
"―――!"
<Page21>
Vlov lets out a roar.
The flames blaze in response to his bellow of rage.
The eternal flames reach a height of several meters,//Not sure what a good TL is for 劫火
and the river of flame splits into dozens of streams.
<Page22>
The underground arena turns into a forest of fire.
The wall of flames blocks off Arcueid's escape.
And with the stage set,
<Page23>
a hand of unparalleled heat is unleashed towards Arcueid, melting the rubble in its path.
<Page24>
"Arcueid―――!"
In one instant.
The tides of battle are turned in an instant.
<Page25>
Arcueid said that she could withstand temperatures of up to 3000℃.
However, the 'hand' that melted the rubble with ease had a temperature well over that.
<Page26>
He could even stack three of them, in the face of which not even ashes can remain. The flames become a tormenting tongue, playing with their prey who are unable to escape.
The white figure burns away without a trace.
―――Or that's what would have occurred if this had happened last night.
<Page27>
The flames are torn apart.
A white skirt flutters in the air.
As if I had been mesmerized, I'm unable to tear my eyes away from her transformation.
<Page28>
I recall her saying something earlier.
'I have a countermeasure. I will recreate my body beforehand.'
<Page29>
The black and white <battle costume|d r e s s        > defies Vlov's flames.
Did it consume the flames? Or did she appear this way simply as a result of recreating her body?
<Page30>
In any case, the flames are unable to affect her now.
Arcueid's countermeasure is flawless.
As soon as she identified that her opponent was a monster of flames, our escape from the hotel assured her victory.
<Page31>
A hand of flame is unleashed.
Arcueid casually thrusts out her left hand.
In a motion similar to combing her hair, she disperses the towering walls of flames on all sides.
<Page32>
The wall of flames bows its head, submitting to the white dress.
Her golden hair soars like a shooting star.
<Page33>
The power of the swinging claws in flight is beyond anything I have ever seen.
As Vlov helplessly retreats, the second and third claws are unleashed.
<Page34>
An overwhelming difference in ability.
It is no longer a battle.
As soon as the flames were nullified, Vlov became mere prey to be hunted.
Arcueid's claws are precise and uninterrupted as they continue to inflict fatal wounds on Vlov's body.
<Page35>
The only reason why Vlov is still standing is because he probably has some blood remaining.
But even that is going to run out at some point. On top of that, there are no humans around from whom to extract resources.
The only blood that remains is that which flows within his own body.
Even that will run out after a few more blows.
<Page36>
In other words, bankruptcy.
If the energy needed to revive his body is lost, his body will rightfully revert back to being a corpse.
<Page37>
"―――Stop, it―――"
He begs for his life without any pretense.
Just like a spoiled child.
His mastery of the machete is also lost.
The vampire swings his machete haphazardly as if to shake off the fear in front of him. But Arcueid is not going to let that disgraceful opening pass by.
<Page38>
"It's cold――― It's cold――― This place, is cold―――!"
The vampire leaps as he lets off a scream.
With the last of his blood, Vlov jumps backwards. No, upwards.
<Page39>
He jumps from the lower ground towards the surface.
Even a height of 40 meters is not enough to stop a vampire.
It's likely that he is planning to replenish his blood supply on the surface.
<Page40>
Green ivy tangles around his legs.
The ivy that sprouted from beneath the rubble grows at a terrifying speed, grabbing Vlov's feet and pulling him back down.
<Page41>
"A―――AA, AAAA―――!"
A river of flame appears once again at Vlov's feet.
Surrounded by a fire that burns only life, the green ivy is reduced to ashes.
However, the shackles do not vanish.
New ivy emerges from the ashes and entwines with the chains.
<Page42>
No matter how many times they burn, the shackles cannot be removed. They continue to loop like a phoenix.
That's right. If vampires are considered immortal, then the workings of nature are also an eternal, infinite cycle.
<Page43>
That ivy is a manifestation of that. The only way to escape is with a fire that burns this entire planet to the core.
But for Vlov――― No, for a 'curse' of a vampire like him, Arcueid's breath alone is more than enough to extinguish it.....!
<Page44>
―――Arcueid runs.
From the intensity of her stance, I can tell that this is the finishing blow.
<Page45>
All of Vlov's counterattacks have been destroyed.
With this, she decides that this is the end of the battle.
I reach the same conclusion.
There is no need to wait for my assistance. At this rate, Arcueid will crush Vlov into pieces.
<Page46>
...And yet.
And yet I can't help but have a bad premonition.
Something is wrong.
His agony and breathing preach out that it is not so.
<Page47>
Vlov's pained complexion is now morbid.
The world where he is alone is different from inside that scorching heat.
A white breath as if it was from a polar opposite world.
<Page48>
...I know those kinds of eyes.
Obsession and defense mechanisms.
He is both the perpetrator and the victim.
That's why―――
――――――We are definitely making a fatal error.
<Page49>
"You idiot... What the hell am I thinking...!?"
Arcueid's victory is inevitable.
There's no way I'm going to interfere at a time like this.
<Page50>
I don't have to do anything.
There's no need for me to go out of my way and enter that hellscape.
Even as I say that, I―――
C:> decide to watch the battle from here.
C:> should stop Arcueid.
