Class is over.
The classroom is buzzing with noise, and I'm the only one sitting in my seat as usual.
<Page2>
"Tohno, please come here for a minute."
The physics teacher calls out from the podium.
"Yes, what is it?"
I replied and went to the podium.
<Page3>
"I just wanted to check something. I have recently received a report that you have been seen late at night in the downtown area. Do you remember it?"
"Yes, I do. I've been in the city late at night for the last few days.
"Ooh. Was it true?
<Page4>
The physics teacher looked at me with difficulty and then apologetically.
"I know that you are not a night owl, but it has come up in a staff meeting. The teachers from the Student Guidance Department want to talk to you.
Because of that, go to the tea ceremony room after school."
Then, the teacher left the classroom.
<Page5>
After school.
When I turned up at the tea room, the guidance teacher had not yet arrived.
<Page6>
The school does not have a tutorial room.
Most of the time it is held in an empty classroom or staff room, but sometimes, as today, it is in an unused club room.
......Apparently, the Tea Ceremony Club was discontinued a long time ago. Certainly, Tea Ceremony Clubs are not popular nowadays.
<Page7>
"―――――"
I sit upright on the tatami and wait for the student guidance teacher.
".........kuh."
I bite my lip.
I know I don't have time for this.
I know, but I don't have any other choice.
<Page8>
The school building is becoming quieter and quieter as club activities are banned and the school day ends earlier.
...... It makes me mad.
I don't know why I'm here, doing this.
<Page9>
I'm so angry at myself for being so helpless.
But since there is no way to solve this problem, I have to do what I am told like a fool.
<Page10>
"...... What am I doing?"
There was no answer.
I waited for night to fall in the deserted club room, holding back the frustration in my chest.
<Page11>
Ding.
The long second hand ticks down to tell me that it is past 6 o'clock.
No one had come to the tea room.
The school closes at 4 o'clock and the teachers leave at 5 o'clock, which means that there is no one left in the school building.
<Page12>
"I wonder if they forgot about me......."
I vaguely think that's a convenient.
After all, the reason for returning to the mansion has been crushed.
It's not that I don't want to go back, but I just can't at the moment.
<Page13>
I break my leg and stand up.
......This tea room is not bad.# After all this time alone with my thoughts, I think I've come to my senses a bit.
<Page14>
I've been thinking a lot.
About what I should do. What my priorities should be.
I'm going to...
C:> Search for Arcueid, even if it's useless.
C:> Return to the mansion.
C:> Look for Roa on my own.
