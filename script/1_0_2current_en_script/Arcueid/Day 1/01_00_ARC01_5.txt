The main gate is tightly closed.
As a child, I had only thought of it as a large house, but after living in the normally-sized Arima house, I realized how huge this mansion really was.//　子供の頃は『とにかく広い家』ぐらいにしか思っていなかったが、一般家庭である有間家で暮らした後だと、改めてどれだけ巨大なのか実感できる。
<Page2>
The hills overlooking the city are all managed by the Tohno family.
The site is larger than our high school, and if you include the forest that spreads out behind it, it's probably three times as big.
<Page3>
The grounds are surrounded by a long wall and trees, making it impossible to peek inside.//　敷地は長い塀と木々で囲われ、中の様子を窺う事はできない。
The main gate, which is the entrance to the property, is closed in a way that says 'no one may enter'.//　入り口である正門は来るものを拒むように閉ざされている。naturalized a little bit.
<Page4>
Next to the bigger gate for cars, there is a doorway for people.//　乗用車を通す門の横には、人間用の出入り口がある。"bigger" added because without a comparator, this reads a little bit awkwardly.
After a moment of hesitation, I press the button that seems to be the doorbell.
<Page5>
Unlike a normal intercom, there was no ringing to be heard by the person who pressed the button.
After a few seconds of waiting, the lock on the door releases and a prerecorded voice invites me to enter.
<Page6>
"...The door is fully automatic now. There used to be a guard..."
<Page7>
I open the heavy door and enter the premises, passing through the stone gate.
The door locks tightly behind me with a satisfying clunk.//　背後で、カシュ、と小気味よい音をたて、扉は固く<施錠|ロック>された。
<Page8>
After passing through the main gate, a gently sloping path leads deeper and deeper into the forest.//　正門を過ぎると、なだらかなスロープの道が奥へ奥へと伸びていた。
Surrounded by tall trees, the path gives me the impression of a tunnel.//　高い木々に囲まれた道はトンネルを思わせる。
It extends straight east and after about 40-or-so meters, it makes a right-angle turn to the north.//　道は東に向かってまっすぐ伸び、40メートルほどで北側へ直角に折れている。
<Page9>
"――――――"
Memories come flooding back with each step; it's like they're being colored in.//　一歩進むごと、<彩|いろ>づくように記憶が蘇る。
I know this path.
I ran along it countless times.//　この道を幾度となく駆け抜けた。
<Page10>
Almost there.
Arriving at the corner and with my feet facing north―――on the left, there lies...
<Page11>
The Tohno mansion, towering high, like a great wall of chalk.
I let out a sigh that could be of either admiration or resignation.
<Page12>
It hasn't changed at all.　屋敷はあの頃と何も変わっていない。 "あの頃と" dropped because it's implied
According to my father, the house was heavily renovated after the war. The basic construction however was inherited by my grandfather, who himself inherited it from his own grandfather's generation.//　父の話では戦後に大きく改修をしたものの、基本的な構造は祖父のそのまた祖父の代から引き継いだものだという。Is "基本的な構造" referring to the foundation or the actual basic structure rather than 下地 or something?
<Page13>
This is a castle for a powerful man. A man from a family who has been in this land for hundreds of years.//　何百年以上も前からこの土地に在り続けた権力者の城。"何百年以上" translated as "hundreds of years" because "more than hundreds of years" makes no sense. Moreover, 権力者 is translated as "man from a powerful family" because otherwise it sounds like Makihisa has been alive for hundreds of years.
For Makihisa... no, for all members of the Tohno family, this mansion has been a sanctuary.
<Page14>
I remember at the annual family reunion, several adults would try to get my father to rent them a corner of the mansion.
<Page15>
They were all probably successful businessmen with their own mansions. But for some reason, they were obsessed with living here.
For them, living in this land must have been very prestigious.
...Really, how ridiculous. I'm not familiar with the values of the upper class, so for me it's just a 'luxurious mansion'.
<Page16>
"......Alright."
There's no turning back now; not after I've come this far.//　ここまで来たら引き返す事はできない。lit. "If I've come this far, there's no turning back now".
Next to the double doors, there's an incongruous doorbell.//　両開きの扉の横には、不釣り合いな呼び鈴がある。
<Page17>
I shake off my nervousness and push the doorbell.
There's no familiar ding-dong sound.
<Page18>
The heavy silence continues for a several seconds.
I can hear the sounds of hurried footsteps coming from the other side of the door.
<Page19>
"Yes, I have been expecting you."
Despite its heavy appearance, the door opens lightly.
<Page20>
I squint at the light of the setting sun shining through the window.
I had prepared for this situation, but I still gulp and look around the vast lobby.//　こうなると覚悟していたのに、息を呑んで広大なロビーを見渡してしまった。does he gasp in game? Otherwise, I'm pretty sure this is "gulp".
<Page21>
...Any visitor would be overwhelmed by the architectural beauty.//　……訪れる者を圧倒する建築美。
I get the striking feeling that I've been transported to a different country in a different time. The interior of the mansion is so dated that even the atmosphere is different.//　どこか違う国、違う時代にタイムスリップしてしまった錯覚に襲われる。屋敷の内装はあまりにも時代がかっていて、その空気さえ違っていた。
<Page22>
Still, this is the Tohno residence lobby of my memories.//　それでも、ここは見覚えのある遠野邸のロビーだ。
<Page23>
As I stand there stock-still, in front of me is the sole person who had come to greet me: a girl in anachronistic clothes.//　立ち尽くす俺の前には、出迎えに来てくれた、これまた時代錯誤な服装の少女がひとり。
<Page24>
"Thank goodness. I was worried that you might be lost since you were so late.
If you had not made it here before sundown, I would have come to get you."
The girl wearing a kimono and an apron is laughing with a grin.//　着物にエプロンを付けた少女はニコニコと笑っている。
<Page25>
"Ah, no―――"
I'm so bewildered by this unexpected turn of events that I can't speak coherently.
I'd assumed that the person waiting to welcome me would surely have been the rugged-looking butler who had been Makihisa's secretary.//　てっきり、出迎えてくれるのは槙久の秘書でもあった、いかつい顔の執事さんと思いこんでいた。
<Page26>
"?"
The girl tilts her head gently as if puzzled by my confused attitude.
<Page27>
"You are Shiki-sama, right?"
"Y-Yes. Although, addressing me with a '-sama' is a bit excessive."
<Page28>
"Isn't it? Oh, please do not scare me like that again.//「ですよね？　もう、脅かさないでください。
I was afraid I made a mistake again."
<Page29>
The girl in the apron presses her forefinger to her lips with a warning gesture, like a mother scolding her child.
It would appear that she really did worry, and is now quite cross. Even so, the smile remains on her face and the girl retains her warm composure.//　どうやら本気で心配し、怒っているらしい。それでも微笑は絶やさず、少女は温かな雰囲気を崩さない。
<Page30>
...Kimono and apron.
She comes to greet me like this and refers to me with a '-sama'.
So, this girl is――――
<Page31>
"Excuse me. Are you a maid here by any chance?"//「すみません。もしかして、ここのお手伝いさんですか？」 "手伝いさん" is much softer than "servant". "The help" would be a lovely translation if it wasn't so condescending. Also, not using either 使用人 or 侍女.
"――――――"
The girl answers my question only with a smile.
<Page32>
"You must be tired, right?
Please do not hesitate to come in. Make yourself at home in the living room until Akiha-sama is free."
<Page33>
The girl starts walking as if guiding me, her every movement gentle and calm.//　少女は俺を先導するように、ゆったりとした動作で歩き出した。
She walks toward the corridor on the east side of the lobby, next to the grand staircase.
<Page34>
I believe the living room is just inside that hallway.
I―――
C:> Decide to obediently follow her.
C:> Decide to stop the girl and ask for her name.
C:> ...Well, I think I'll explore the mansion a little.
