...Of course, I'm thinking about my sister Akiha.//　……やはり、妹の秋葉の事だ。choice from 1_4
<Page2>
In the beginning, when I was left at the Arima household, Akiha came to visit me several times.
Unfortunately, she couldn't see me often because I had to go to the hospital every day. After she went off to a boarding school, we only exchanged a few letters.
<Page3>
Unlike Akiha, I'm no longer a member of the main family.//Since he was technically the eldest son of the Tohno family and was only booted out afterwards
That was why I was able to lead a free and easy life.
For these last seven years, I'm glad to say I've had no contact with my sister.//　ここ七年ばかり、妹との接点は皆無といってよかった。technically more like "my contact with my sister has been nil"
<Page4>
To be honest, the idea that I want to return hadn't crossed my mind even after all this time.//　正直なところ、いまさら遠野の家に戻りたいとは思ってはいなかった。
But Akiha is there.
As a child,
Akiha was quiet and always timid as if she were enduring something; she was always depending on me and following me around.//　秋葉はおとなしくて、いつも何かを我慢しているように怯えていて、頼りなげに俺の後についてきた。
<Page5>
Perhaps it was her long black hair and luxurious clothes, but Akiha seemed like a captive princess straight out of a fairy tale. A fragile girl.//　長い黒髪と豪華な洋服のせいか、秋葉は童話に出てくる囚われの姫のように、<儚|はかな>げな少女だった。
Even though I have no right to act like a big brother now, I have been worried about Akiha's future these past seven years.//　いまさら兄貴ぶる資格はないと分かっていても、この七年間、秋葉の将来を案じていた。
<Page6>
So―――when I heard the news of Makihisa's death, my first concern was for her.
<Page7>
In that vast mansion without father, she was left alone.//　あの広い屋敷で父親をなくし、ひとりきりになった妹。
More than anything, I feel guilty about forcing the duties of the Tohno family on her and living a selfish life.//　なにより、遠野家の義務をあいつに押しつけて勝手気侭に暮らしていた自分に負い目もある。 "自分に負い目もある。" is not explicitly translated but I feel like it's implied.
I think the reason why I agreed to come back to the mansion may have been to apologize to her.
