<Page1>
In contrast to the pale tones of the living room, the dominant theme of the office is red.//そこは白を基調にした居間とは対照的な、赤を基調とした空間だった。
<Page2>
A luxurious curtain. A crimson carpet without a single stain.
The air is heavy and dignified. You can't help but feel the rich history of the room.//重苦しい空気は格調高く、長い歴史を否応なしに感じさせる。
This is the office... of the head of the Tohno family. Thus where Akiha sits before me was once Tohno Makihisa's room.//　これが執務室……かつては遠野槙久が、そして今は遠野秋葉が座る、遠野家当主の部屋だった。
<Page3>
"I have brought Shiki-sama with me."
"Thank you. You can go back to work, Kohaku."
"Yes. If you will excuse me."
<Page4>
Sounds like the maid's name is Kohaku.//　お手伝いさんは琥珀という名前らしい。
She also gives me a small bow and leaves the room.//琥珀さんは俺にも小さくおじぎをして退室した。
The only ones left are myself and ―――two girls that I don't recognize.
<Page5>
She also gives me a small bow and leaves the room.//琥珀さんは俺にも小さくおじぎをして退室した。
The only ones left are myself and ―――two girls that I don't recognize.
<Page6>
"It's been a while, Nii-san."
The girl with long black hair says these nuanced words with a dignified look in her eyes.//　長い黒髪の少女は凛とした眼差しで、そんな意味合いの言葉を口にした。
<Page7>
"――――――"
My mind is completely blank.
My thoughts have stopped entirely.
<Page8>
I can't even greet her properly, only capable of responding with an 'Ah' while nodding my head.
I feel rather pathetic to be discouraged over it but I don't know what else to do.//　自分の情けなさに落胆するが、それも仕方ないと思う。
The Akiha before me now looks very different from the one I knew seven years ago.
<Page9>
"...Nii-san? Is there something wrong with this room?"//「……兄さん？　何か、この部屋に不審な点でも？」 lit. "is there any strange point in this room?"
As if carefully observing her suspicious visitor, the black-haired girl squints faintly.//　挙動不審な来訪者を冷静に観察するように、黒髪の少女はかすかに目を細める。
<Page10>
"Ah, ―――no."
I can't get my head straight yet. I can only reply with dumb words.//　まだ頭が切り替わらず、間の抜けた言葉しか返せない。
My mind is operating at full-capacity trying to recognize the girl in front of me as Akiha. She on the other hand, seems to have long-since recognized me as her brother.//　こっちは目前の少女を秋葉と認識するため頭をフル回転させているのに、秋葉の方はとっくに俺を兄と認めているようだ。
<Page11>
"―――Sigh. I have only heard the stories, but it seems to be true that your physical condition is quite unstable. While it is time poorly spent, would you rather rest before we talk?"
...And then.
Akiha's words seem to have a certain sting to them.
<Page12>
"N-No, I'm not doing that badly. I was just surprised at how much you've changed."//「い、いや、体調はそう悪くない。秋葉があんまりにも変わってたんで、びっくりしたというか」
<Page13>
"...Things change after seven years. That's what it means to grow up. Or did you think everything would always stay the same, Nii-san?"
"No, that's not―――"
I'm so overwhelmed by her subtle pressure that I can't speak properly.
<Page14>
...Or rather, I started to reflect on everything.
I hadn't imagined what the current Akiha would be like.
I hadn't thought outside of the realm of childhood memories convenient to me as her brother.//　いつまでも子供のままの、兄貴として都合のいい思い出から先を考えていなかったのだ。fairly liberally translated to localize
I wonder how the seven years have made Akiha develop. Ah, but it's way too rude to think about this in front of her.//　七年間の月日が秋葉をどう成長させたのか。それを本人を目の前にして思い知るなんて、失礼にも程がある。
<Page15>
"...I'm ashamed. To be honest, I didn't think it through.
But then again, you've changed. You're a remarkably more beautiful than you used to be."//　でも、それにしたって秋葉は変わったよ。昔より格段に美人になった」
I give my honest opinion.
<Page16>
"Thank you.//「ありがとうございます。
Although you have not changed much since back then."
Akiha coldly makes an assertion with her eyes closed.//　瞳を閉じたまま、秋葉は冷たく言い切った。
<Page17>
"........."
...Well, I was prepared for this, but...
It seems that Akiha doesn't think well of me after I left the Tohno family.
<Page18>
"......"
"――――――"
<Page19>
The silence lasts only a few seconds, as each of us tries to figure out what the other will do.
I can't think of a casual greeting to say to my sister with whom I'm reunited.
Akiha is observing me as if I were a stranger, although I suppose I really am a stranger to her.//　秋葉はそんな俺を<余所者|よそもの>―――実際、秋葉にとってはもう余所者なんだろうが―――のように観察している。 original jp is more working through the thought that he's a stranger.
<Page20>
"...Well, that's fine then.//「……まあいいでしょう。
If you're feeling well, then let us finish our conversation.//　体調が良いのなら話を済ませましょう。
Have you been informed of the details regarding the circumstances of your move?"
<Page21>
"No, I don't know the detailed situation. I was just told that 'You are to come back to the mansion.' I only read about the death of the old man in the newspaper."//「いや、詳しい事情は何も。いいから屋敷に帰ってこいって話だけだ。<槙久|おやじ>が亡くなった事は新聞で知ったけど」 in game, which does Shiki /actually/ say: old man or Makihisa?
<Page22>
When the head of a business group passes away, it is covered in the financial columns.//企業グループのトップに立っていた人物が亡くなれば、それぐらい経済新聞で取りあげられる。
Even if he isn't informed by his relatives, a disowned son can still learn of his parents' death from news sites.//　親戚から報せはなくても、勘当された息子はニュースサイトで親の不幸を知れる世の中だ。
The news of Tohno Makihisa's death was delivered to the Arima family after his funeral. It was as if it was none of my business.
<Page23>
"...You have my apologies. It was my fault for not informing you about father."
<Page24>
Akiha quietly bows her head.
Her smooth black hair is beautiful, ...but now is not the time to be admiring it. I shouldn't have said that earlier.
<Page25>
"You don't have to worry about that.
It's not like the dead would have come back to life if I was there. On the contrary, I'm glad I didn't have to see any of my relatives."//　俺が行ったって死人が生き返るわけでもないんだ。逆に、親戚筋に会わなくて助かった」
Being disowned puts you in a complicated position in many ways.
<Page26>
"...I see.
It makes me feel a little better to hear you say that."
<Page27>
The same goes for me, having a sister as frank as her.
Funerals are a ritual for those who cannot forget the deceased to lay their feelings to rest.
For a father and son who severed their ties long before.//　とうの昔に関わりを断ってきた息子と父親。
I can't think of a single reason to say goodbye to Tohno Makihisa. I have neither the right nor the duty to see him off.
<Page28>
"But then, who called me back?
It's not like it was in his will, right?"
<Page29>
"It was my decision to call you back here, Nii-san.//「兄さんをこちらに呼び戻したのは私の決定です。
It would be strange for the eldest son of the Tohno family to be kept in the Arima house forever, would it not? No matter what your defects are, you are still a Tohno."
<Page30>
"......"
I have come to accept the word 'defect' as natural.//　欠陥、という言葉を自然に受け止める。
My father used it thoroughly.//　その言葉はさんざん親父に言われたものだ。Note that 親父 is written in Kanji.
I don't feel any dissatisfaction or animosity toward being told this now. Her assessment is absolutely correct.//　今さら言われたところで不満も反感も覚えないし、その診断はまったく正しい。
<Page31>
"Now that father... that Tohno Makihisa is dead, the only members of the Tohno bloodline left are you and me, Nii-san.
That blood must be protected.
I do not know what father had in mind when he entrusted you to the Arima family, but he has passed away.
Without a definite reason, as your family, it's only natural to supervise you here."//　理由が定かではない以上、遠野志貴をこちらで監督するのは家族として当然の事でしょう」
<Page32>
Akiha's words are calm but compelling.
It is as if she is declaring in advance that she won't listen to any of my complaints or protests.
<Page33>
"...Supervision, huh. So what would have happened if I had refused to come back to the Tohno house?"
<Page34>
"The freedom to decide that is not yours. No one from the Arima branch has the right to refuse a decision from the head family.
You and I were both raised by Tohno household. At least until you reach adulthood and become an independen member of society, it is your obligation to serve the Tohno family."//　私も兄さんも、遠野家に育てられた者です。少なくとも成人し、社会的に自立するまでは、貴方は遠野家に隷属する義務があります」 first 遠野家 is "Tohno household" because I consider it a little ambiguous who raised him in this sentence.
<Page35>
"........."
That's what Makihisa said too.
Parents have a responsibility to raise their children and send them off as members of society.
<Page36>
A family is no more than the smallest <subdivision|c o m p a n y     > that makes up a nation, and as a company, you mustn't ship defective products.
This not only damages the name of the family but also lowers the quality of the whole country.
<Page37>
Those who cannot take on that responsibility are not qualified to be parents, and children who cannot live up to that responsibility have no reason to be part of a family.
Tohno Makihisa told this to me and Akiha many times. It was as if he was persuading himself, over and over again.//　遠野槙久はこんな話を何度も俺と秋葉に語った。まるで自分自身に言い聞かせるように、何度も何度も。
<Page38>
"That was one of his favorite phrases, wasn't it.//「<槙久|おやじ>の口癖だったな。口癖 is like "favorite phrase"/"pet saying"/etc.
So the reason you called me back is simply..."
It wasn't consideration for her brother, who was disowned by their father.//　<偏屈|へんくつ>な父に勘当された兄の心情をおもんぱかっての事ではなく、心情 is missing here but it reads ok.
<Page39>
"It's because regardless of how we got here, you are the eldest son of the Tohno family.//「どのような経緯であれ、貴方が遠野家の長男だからです。
Do you not think that is enough of a reason?"
As the head of the Tohno family, she is just cleaning up a matter that had been left unattended to.
<Page40>
"I am glad you understand.
Needless to say, you should take my words as those of the head of the Tohno family. The family register may list you as my older brother, but the hierarchy within our family is a different thing."//　言うまでもありませんが、私の発言は遠野家当主のものとして受け取ってください。戸籍上では貴方は私の兄ですが、この家における上下関係はまた別のものです」
<Page41>
"Nii-san. I respect you as my brother, but at the same time, as the one who is in charge of this house, I will treat you as the property of the Tohno family.
Please forget about what happened seven years ago and engrave into your mind that I am the head and you are part of the family."
<Page42>
Akiha's voice is indifferent.
A prideful decision made from above. I felt that it was cold-hearted, true.//<権高|けんだか>な、上の立場から下される決定。そこに冷たいものを感じたのは事実だ。
But―――
<Page43>
"Yeah, I understand when you put it like that.
I feel more at ease when I hear it from you straight."
This is a natural outcome.
It's nothing to be upset about.
<Page44>
"...You understand what I am saying?//……私の言葉を理解していますか？
It was my intention to use my position above you to unilaterally force you to consent, but..."//私は兄さんより上の立場で、それを承諾しろと一方的に宣言したつもりですけど……
<Page45>
"I know, and I'm not complaining. I mean, I'm going to be treated this way no matter what I think about it.
In fact, I'm grateful to you for treating me as your brother, even after I lived a life of self-indulgence for seven years."//「けど、秋葉の考えは別にして、親戚の連中がよく納得したな。俺を有間の家に預けろって言い出したの、たしか親戚の人たちじゃなかったっけ？」
".........."
<Page46>
"But regardless of what you think, didn't the relatives object? Weren't they the ones who suggested that I stay at the Arima house?"
<Page47>
"Yes, they did. But I am the current head of the family. I rejected all of their opinions.
I have made it clear that to interfere in this matter is to go against me, and by extension, against the Tohno family."
<Page48>
"――――――"
Unconsciously, my eyes get wide.//　思わず目を見張る。
Even Makihisa couldn't reject the branch families. But for Akiha to persuade all of them... no, maybe she argued them down.
...Well.//　……ううん。
She has grown up well in appearance, but I wonder how much she has grown up inside as well. The family registrar says I'm her older brother and I'm a little scared of my sister's rapid development.//　外見も立派に育ったけど、その中身もどれだけの成長を果たしたのか。戸籍上・兄として、妹の急成長がちょっと怖い。JP has some weird formatting at the end.
<Page49>
"...Nii-san?
You have a distant look on your face. What's wrong?"//　ぼうとしたお顔をされていますが、何か？」 "何か" is quite terse
<Page50>
"Oh, no, I'm impressed, or rather, moved... you've really been recognized as the head of the family."
"Of course. Otherwise, I would not be able to call you back, Nii-san."
<Page51>
"Back to the matter at hand.
From today on, you will be living in the mansion, but there are rules and regulations here. You will refrain from misbehaving like you did in the past, so please keep that in mind."
<Page52>
"Huh? Haha, that's impossible, Akiha.
There's no way I can go back to being a well-behaved person now, and I have no intention of trying to either."
<Page53>
"No, you will, no matter what.
You are not a child, so do not whine before trying.
Or are you implying that you are unable to do the things that I can do?"
She shoots me a cold glance.//　じろり、と秋葉は冷たい視線を向けてくる。
<Page54>
"――――――"
Or rather, her gaze is more like a piercing spear.
"Uh..."
There's no doubt about it. I'm now being mercilessly bombarded with the animosity that has piled up during these last seven years...
<Page55>
"...Okay. I'll try as hard as I can."
"You will try, will you? That is a convenient response.
Do you think that anyone who makes an effort will be rewarded? The only thing I am looking for is results; that is all."
<Page56>
"Ugh....."
I'm completely dumbfounded by her lack of even an ounce of kindness.//　優しさが一ミリもない感想に二の句も継げない兄だった。literally 'having a milimeter' of kindness. Naturalized to fit a real english expression.
<Page57>
"...Fine. You have been living a free and easy life until now, so I do not expect you to change it immediately.
I will give you a week at the very least and a month at most, so try like your life depends on it."
<Page58>
I hold back the thought that this seems more like a suspended sentence than being let off the hook.//　猶予は猶予でもそれは執行猶予というものではないか、という思いつきをぐっと堪える。 'probation' is usually a release rather than a temporary period.
Akiha is making a compromise in her own way. I'm sure.
<Page59>
"...You know what? It's not as difficult as it may seem.
You and I are the only ones living in the mansion now.
It would have been hard for you to relax with all those noisy relatives around, and they were quite a nuisance for me too, so I sent them away."
<Page60>
"―――"
Wait a minute... you don't mean...
"You got rid of all the relatives staying in the mansion?"# To think, she was able to do that...!
<Page61>
"Yes, please do not worry about it.
They are merely people who, while losing their own homes and property, were leeching off father's generosity without making any effort. Sooner or later, we were going to ask them to leave the mansion.//　家と財産を失いながら、なんの努力もせずお父様の恩情にすがっていただけの方々です。遅かれ早かれ、屋敷から出て行ってもらう予定でした。
Oh, I have let most of the servants go, but I have left one for each of us, so there is no problem."
<Page62>
"No, that's way too much! If you go around doing things like that, you'll be brought up for questioning at the next family reunion!"
<Page63>
"Please stop blathering on so much.//「もう、つべこべ言わないでください。
Would you not feel more comfortable if we were the only ones in the mansion instead of it being teeming of people?"//　兄さんだって屋敷の中に人が溢れかえっているより、私たちしかいないほうが気持ちは楽でしょう？」
<Page64>
...Ugh.
Well, it really does make me feel better...
<Page65>
"...No, but, you know, is that really okay?
Even the old man didn't go against the opinions of our relatives, so for you to force through something so tyrannical and selfish..."//親父だって親戚の意見には逆らわなかったのに、そんな、暴君みたいなワガママを通しちまって......」
<Page66>
"That is right. That is why father entrusted you to the Arima family. But I have hated those people since I was a child. From now on, I'm done. I'm fed up with listening to their grumbling."//「そうですね。だからお父様は兄さんを有間の家に預けたんです。けれど私、子供の頃からあの人達が大っ嫌いでしたから。これ以上、どうでもいい彼らの小言を聞くのは御免です」
"'fed up with'? Akiha―――"
<Page67>
"Oh for heaven's sake, it's oh-so-wonderful that you're so worried about the likes of me!//「ああもう、いいから私なんかの心配は結構です
But you should be more worried about your own life from now on. It's obvious that you are going to have a lot of trouble going forwards."//　そんな事より、兄さんはこれからのご自分の生活を案じてください。色々大変なコトになるって目に見えているんだから」
<Page68>
Akiha said unpleasantly, forcing the discussion to a close.
<Page69>
"I am sure you understand the situation, but it seems that you still treat this as if you are living with the Arima family.
...Well, not that it matters. I have a servant for that purpose.
If you have any questions in the future, you can ask her.
――――Hisui."
<Page70>
Without turning around, Akiha calls out to the girl who was waiting in the corner of the room.
<Page71>
The girl called Hisui steps forward and bows in my direction.
It is an expressionless but polite bow, a crystallization of sincerity.
<Page72>
"This girl is Hisui, a servant of our mansion.
She will be your maid from now on, is that alright?"
I see, so she's a servant here... wait, what?
<Page73>
"Wait, by maid, you mean..."
"A personal servant would be a better description."
<Page74>
...I can't believe it.
As someone who looks the same age as Akiha, the girl in the maid's uniform doesn't show any expression, as if it's natural for her to do so.
<Page75>
"Wait a minute. Isn't it too much to have a personal servant? I can take care of myself..."//自分の事ぐらい自分で面倒をみれるっていうか
"Even when it comes to preparing meals and doing laundry?"
Akiha's point is relentlessly sharp.
<Page76>
"In any case, now that you have returned to this mansion, you will follow my instructions.
I do not know how you lived in the Arima house, but from now on you are living here as the eldest son of the Tohno family.
Please accept the appropriate treatment as your duty."
<Page77>
"Ugh..."
I sweep my gaze over the girl in the maid's uniform.
Hisui is still expressionless, just staring back at me like a doll.
<Page78>
"Alright then, Hisui, please guide my brother to his room.
It seems this man is no different from a cat who does not know left from right. Do not let him get lost in this big mansion."
"As you please, Akiha-sama."
<Page79>
After bowing to Akiha, Hisui quietly comes toward me.//秋葉に一礼し、翡翠はしずしずとこちらにやってくる。
Her line of sight is now directed at me, but I look all over the place so that our eyes don't meet.
...Her pace is gentle but not slow, indicating that she has been a servant for a long time.
<Page80>
"Oh, Nii-san. Even as the eldest son, there are certain things that are forbidden in this mansion, like places that you should not enter. Please do not violate these rules.
I have also ordered Hisui to take care of you, so please listen to her advice as much as possible."
<Page81>
"That doesn't seem like being taken care of but more like being monitored, don't you think?"
"If you live a proper life not breaking any rules, Hisui will be relieved of that role.//「兄さんが規則正しい生活をしてくだされば、翡翠もそんな役割から解放されます。
With that, I will see you again at the dinner table."
<Page82>
It seems that Akiha has a packed schedule and doesn't want to waste any more time.
<Page83>
"I will show you to your room, Shiki-sama."
Hisui heads for the door, unconcerned about my state of bewilderment.
"...Hah."
Sighing, I leave the office as well.
