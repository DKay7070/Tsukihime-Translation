After dinner, I return to my room.
The time is now 9:30.
I spent a full two hours in the dining room.
<Page2>
"Welcome back, Shiki-sama. Although you did not instruct me to do so, I have prepared your bed."
<Page3>
...she says. // reads weirdly but no fix yet
Hisui was quietly making the bed in my room.
It seems that she had returned a step ahead of me to get things ready.
<Page4>
"Ah―――yes, thank you."
"As for your pajamas, please use the ones over there.
If you could put your clothes in the basket and leave it out in the hallway, that would be very helpful."
<Page5>
A woven wooden basket is placed at the foot of the bed.
It seems that if I were to put my worn clothes into the basket and leave it in the hallway, she'll do the laundry.
...It's getting more and more like a luxury hotel.
<Page6>
"Do you have any questions?"
Hisui asks without moving an eyebrow.
I have many questions, but I don't know anything about Hisui and Kohaku-san at all.
<Page7>
"This isn't really relevant, but can I ask something?"
"Yes, what is it?"
"I'd like to know what kind of work you and Kohaku-san do here, if you don't mind."
<Page8>
"I am in charge of Shiki-sama, and my sister Kohaku is in charge of taking care of Lady Akiha. We are both in charge of the mansion while you two are away, what about it?"
"...Taking care, you say. That's what I thought."
<Page9>
My shoulders are heavy with disappointment.
Akiha said it as if it was obvious, but I'm just an ordinary high school student.
Having a girl around my own age look after me isn't to my taste right now.
<Page10>
"...Does that mean you're my personal maid?"
"Yes. I will always be at your service."
Hisui bows deeply.
The prickling pain in my chest is brought on by my selfish guilt.
<Page11>
"All right. From the way Akiha puts it, she's not going to let me be alone. Plus, I don't think making her dismiss you just to make allowance for me is a good thing. So I'll accept your help but―――"//「分かった。秋葉のあの言いぶりじゃ俺を一人にはしないだろうし、そもそも俺の気持ちの問題で君を解雇させるのは良くはないと思う。ありがたくお世話になるけど―――」
<Page12>
"Do you have any special requests?"
"It's not that big of a deal... but um, 'Shiki-sama' is a bit too much for me.
I'm not that kind of person, and to be honest, it's so far above me that I feel like I've been grabbed by the scruff of my neck." //I feel like there must be a better way to translate 分不相応 than "unworthy", but this isn't much better. Also, being grabbed by the neck vs by the scruff/nape of the neck has very different connotations - it's more like being carried around like a baby cat than choked.
<Page13>
"But, you are my master."
"You could say that but I've been living a normal life until today.
It's a little difficult to live a life where you've just returned home and someone your age addresses you as their master."
'I see,' Hisui replies unenthusiastically.
<Page14>
"You can refer to me as Tohno-san or Shiki-san. I don't want to be too formal.
Then, I'll refer to you as Hisui-san in return."
<Page15>
"........."
Hisui lowers her eyebrows expressionlessly and bites her lips hard.
...Oh, man.
I wanted to make it easier for her, but it didn't work and only made things more difficult.
<Page16>
"But, you are my employer."
"I'm not the one hiring you, am I?"
<Page17>
"...With all due respect, it is the same thing, Shiki-sama.
I am a servant of the Tohno family. Whether if it is the head of the family and any of their relatives, it does not change the fact that they are all revered as masters.
Therefore, please only refer to me as Hisui if you can.
I hope you can understand the feelings of a servant who is called with an honorific by the person she serves."
<Page18>
"―――Mm."
...I can't argue with her when she says it like that.
Her remarks make sense as a servant.
<Page19>
"...Hah. You do things I can't do, so I'm the one who should be thanking you..."
It will only trouble Hisui more if I keep stressing my point.
For now, I'll express my intentions as best I can.
<Page20>
"Should I call you Hisui then?"
"Yes, no matter what."
"...Haha."
That was a sharper response from Hisui than I had expected. //『なんとしても』という言い方がちょっと食い気味の翡翠だった
<Page21>
"Okay. I'll do that.
But please don't be too formal with me. I'd appreciate it if you could let your sister, Kohaku-san, know about this as well."
"Yes. If you say so, Shiki-sama."
<Page22>
Hisui bows her head.
―――Alright. We have a long way to go before we can have a frank conversation.
<Page23>
Hisui bows and leaves the room.
As soon as I am alone, I feel a rush of fatigue.
...Too much has happened since this morning.
My body is in desperate need of sleep.
<Page24>
I turn off the lights and lie down in bed.
A narcotic desire to sleep.
My exhausted body drains the vitality from my limbs, forcing me to fall asleep.
<Page25>
I keep my eyelids open to resist the temptation, but it's futile.
No matter how much I don't want to sleep, I will eventually fall asleep.
That's how the human body works.
<Page26>
...While I was in between wakefulness and sleep, I gaze at the ceiling in a daze.
<Page27>
...Home for the first time in seven years.
...Seeing my family for the first time in seven years.
...I feel like it's someone else's house.
"――――But I'm back, aren't I?"
...I monologue in order to accept that fact.
<Page28>
...My consciousness sinks to depths from which there is no turning back.
...A mansion on a hill where the bustle of the city does not reach.
...An isolated island surrounded by tall trees.
...At the moment I close my eyes, I come to realize that it feels like being in prison after all this time.
