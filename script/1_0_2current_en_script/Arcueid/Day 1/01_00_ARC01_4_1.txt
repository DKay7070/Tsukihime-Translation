I think back to the incident with my father, Tohno Makihisa.
<Page2>
...I don't have any memories of playing with him though.
Makihisa was a strict father and a quiet man who didn't let his emotions show.//　槙久は厳格な父であったと同時に、無口で、あまり感情を顔に出さない人間だった。"同時に" is sorta dropped here because without a 'but', the sentence doesn't flow well with it in place. I think 'and' is just fine in its place.
<Page3>
'Do not go out, do not go into the city, people are born with different statuses, protect our noble bloodline, we must not be viewed as the same as the others―――'
Those were Makihisa's rules, and by extension, the rules of the Tohno family.//　それが槙久の、ひいては遠野家の決まりだった。
<Page4>
I rebelled against those rules.
I felt that my father's teachings were wrong.
Not because of a mistake in his logic, but because of his lack of persuasiveness.//　それは理屈の間違いではなく、説得力の無さに起因する。
...I'm not so sure now, but as a child, it felt like his teachings didn't even belong in this era.//ruby dots <も|・><う|・><時|・><代|・><じ|・><ゃ|・><な|・><い|・>, for italics

Although I wasn't the only one who disagreed with Makihisa's words, I was the only one who could defy him face to face.
<Page6>
As a result, I began to ignore orders and would frequently escape from the mansion. That's what led to me being involved in the accident.//　結果、俺は言いつけを破って屋敷から頻繁に抜け出すようになり、あの事故に巻きこまれた。
'The world outside the mansion is ugly. It is poison to you.'
It's ironic.
The old man's favorite phrase ended up being true, even if only for me.//　<槙久|おやじ>のその口癖だけは、俺にかぎって正しく機能した。
<Page7>
After I woke up in the hospital, Makihisa didn't come to visit me even once.//　病院で目を覚ました後、槙久は一度も見舞いにこなかった。
My final memory of him was him ordering me to 'go to the Arima house' the day I returned to the mansion after being discharged from the hospital.//　退院し、屋敷に戻ったその日に“有間の家に行け”と命じられたのが最後の記憶だ。
<Page8>
That Makihisa isn't with us anymore either.//　その槙久も、もういない。Is this referring to the 'taciturn but strict' father above?
I think that the fact I'm not experiencing any strong feelings about my father's death speaks volumes about our relationship.//　親の死に目に会えなかった事に何の感慨も浮かばない事が、俺と槙久の関係を表しているように思う。
