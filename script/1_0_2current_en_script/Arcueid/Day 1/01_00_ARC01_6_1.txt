Ten minutes... ten minutes, huh.
I can take a look around the house if I have that much time.
I should be able to take a walk around the east wing, where the living room is, and the first-floor corridor.
<Page2>
"Just staying here will make me nervous..."
I stand up from the sofa.
If I remember correctly, the west wing had a game room with a pool table and darts.
<Page3>
"Oh.# I thought I'd stop by before leaving, but I didn't know we had a prior guest."
Just as I step into the lobby, a voice calls out to me from the stairs.
As I look back at the large staircase leading to the second floor,
there is an all-black figure, far too strange to be real. //Double "all" is weird, "far" or nothing sounds better.
<Page4>
"Hello, Shiki-kun. Welcome to the Tohno residence...# Actually, that's not right. In your case, it would be more apt to say 'welcome back'."
<Page5>
...A man, probably in his thirties by the sound of his voice... saunters into the lobby.//......声からして男性、おそらく三十代......は落ち着いた足取りでロビーに下りてくる。
The fact that he is all-black is not a metaphor.
For whatever reason, he's covered in black bandages; not only on his hands but all the way up to his face.
It makes him look like a suspicious person in a mystery novel.
<Page6>
"......Excuse me, who are you?"
"Hmm? You don't remember?
Ah, I see. It's me, Saiki Gouto.
We saw each other a few times when you were a kid, albeit not like this. Even if you remembered, you wouldn't recognize my face."
<Page7>
Saiki...?
I wonder if there's any branch of the Tohno family with such a name...
No, what I want to know before that―――this person, how should I say it―――//　いや、それ以前に―――この人物は、なんというか―――
<Page8>
"It's alright, I'm used to being looked at strangely.
I burned my face in an accident. For a long time now, I haven't been able to go outside without wearing them. Sunlight is especially harsh.
Akiha also dislikes me, but c'est la vie. She is also partly responsible for this, you know."
<Page9>
With a self-deprecating smile, Saiki lifts his left hand to shade his eyes.//　斎木業人は自嘲するような笑いと共に、かるく左手を目線の上まで持ち上げた。
As if to say that even the setting sun shining through the skylight was unpleasant.//　天窓から差し込む夕日すら疎ましい、と言うかのように。
<Page10>
"However. My, how dare you return just like that."
"...Eh?"
"I'm talking about you, Shiki-kun. You broke Makihisa's orders and escaped from the mansion. As a result, you were involved in that foolish accident and deserted."//「君の事だよ志貴君。槙久の言いつけを破って屋敷を抜け出した結果、くだらない事故に巻きこまれて脱落した」
<Page11>
"Deserted. Yes, deserted. You who threw away your parent's investment and abandoned your duty. Yet here you are, back at the mansion, trying to act like Akiha's brother.
Do you not feel ashamed of yourself?"
<Page12>
"――――――"
I resist the urge to just respond with 'what?'
There's obvious contempt and provocation in Saiki's eyes, but there's no point in making a scene here. After all, he hasn't said anything wrong.
<Page13>
"Oh. Don't you have any objections?"
"None. it's true that I abandoned my duty.
But don't you think it's shameful for you to use words like 'deserted' and 'investment' when talking about family?"
<Page14>
"I chose those words precisely because we were talking about family.
Raising a child is an investment in the family's future. Setting aside the commoners, humans don't have the freedom to pick their bloodline or nobility.//　養育は一族の将来への投資だ。<市井|しせい>の人間はともかく、選ばれた血筋、尊い家系において、個人の自由は存在しない。Although Shiki is adopted, 'fostering' isn't what he means here.
Freedom... no, egotism would describe it better. These are rights that you can only acquire after you become an adult and can carry your family on your shoulders."
<Page15>
"You are a son of the Tohno family, but you didn't understand that. Unlike Akiha, you're third-rate. Well, your nerve is first-rate seeing as how you came back here after falling so low."//「君は遠野の子でありながら、それを理解していなかった。秋葉とは似ても似つかぬ三流だ。まあ、一度地に落ちていながら帰ってくる厚顔さだけは、一流と言えなくもないがね」quite a liberal translation
<Page16>
"――――――"
"Don't stare at me like that, Shiki-kun. It was just an objective statement. It's not my personal assessment.
It seems that I have misled you, as I am not opposed to your return. If anything, I'm in favor of it, and in the first place, it was the decision of the current head of the Tohno family. It's not something that I, an outsider, can say anything about, is it?"
<Page17>
An outsider...?
Then this man is not from a branch of the family?
<Page18>
"The Saiki family has been on an equal footing with the Tohno family since my grandfather's generation. In modern terms, we'd call them business partners.
I was only here on business today. It may have dragged on for quite a while, but I got a satisfying response. I'll be heading home in a good mood.
Aah, the last thing I want to do is spoil your homecoming with my gloomy appearance. Please, excuse me."//　ああ、この陰気な姿でせっかくの帰郷に水を差すのも忍びない。今日はこのあたりで失礼するよ」
<Page19>
The man with the black bandages... heads toward the entrance, passing by me with an cynical smile on his face.//黒い包帯の男......斎木業人は口元に皮肉げな笑みを浮かべたまま俺の横を通りすぎ、玄関口へと去って行った。
<Page20>
"......"
I bit my lip as I recall Saiki calling me a 'deserter'.
It is a very accurate description of my position in this mansion, just as he had said.
<Page21>
...In any case, I need to go back to the living room and calm down.
I'll take a walk around the Tohno mansion later.
I'm going to be reunited with my blood-relative for the first time in seven years, and I can't face Akiha if I'm in such a frustrated mood.//　七年ぶりに肉親と再会するというのに、こんな苛だった気持ちじゃ秋葉に申し訳がない。
<Page22>
"Excuse me."
After exactly ten minutes have elapsed, the girl returns.//　本当にきっかり10分後、彼女は戻ってきた。 "after 10 minutes" makes it sounds like 10 minutes after Saiki left.
<Page23>
"...? Shiki-sama, is there something wrong?"
It seems she noticed that I've been feeling down after hearing Saiki Gouto's words.
<Page24>
"No, it's nothing. I was just a little overwhelmed. Thank you for the tea, it was delicious."
<Page25>
"My, I am flattered.
It is my pleasure. Thank you for the kind words."
She gives me a shy smile, which makes me feel warm as well.
<Page26>
"Leaving that aside, let us move to the main topic.
Sorry to keep you waiting. Since Akiha-sama has finished her business, please come to her office."
<Page27>
I head upstairs via the main staircase in the center of the lobby.
That office... could be called the heart of the Tohno family.
It was Tohno Makihisa's private room as the head of the family, which I was not allowed to enter as a child.
A room used by each successive head of the Tohno family.
Now, my sister Akiha is waiting for me there―――
