...I'll kill some more time.
There's no need to rush out of school.
It's not as if the situation is going to improve if I hurry every single minute or second.

I stroll around the school without any purpose.
There are almost no students in the building or on the school grounds.
It's fortunate that I don't see any familiar faces, but it's a bit eerie that a place that should be crowded is so quiet.

"Speaking of which..."//This is techinically less accurate to the JP text, but it reads more normally this way
As I look around the empty school grounds, I remember an incident from my middle school days.
On a snowy day in winter, I was walking home across an empty schoolyard.
Hearing a noise from the supposedly empty storeroom, I stopped by to see what was going on―――
<Page4>
"Hello. Are you a second-year?
I'm sorry, but can you please stay off the school grounds after school?"
<Page5>
An upperclassman I don't know calls out to me.
It seems that I had somehow stepped onto the school grounds without realizing it.
<Page6>
"I'm sorry, I was just going for a walk. I'll be more careful in the future."
I apologize for my carelessness and leave the grounds.
<Page7>
"Were you not going home?"
"...No, but I'm leaving now. Thank you for your concern."
I thank the upperclassman and leave the school grounds.
<Page8>
It's a good excuse for me to make up my mind.
If I stay in school any longer, I will look suspicious.
I'll go back to the classroom, collect my bag, and return to my 'real home' this time―――
