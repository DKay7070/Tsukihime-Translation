The girl leads me to the living room.
The living room, which I haven't seen in seven years, is so different in terms of scale that I feel as if I'm seeing it for the first time.
<Page2>
I wonder if I've gotten too used to the Arima house, or if the standards here have risen in these past seven years.
Either way, I feel like this is a stranger's home and it makes me uncomfortable.
I start to look around the living room.
<Page3>
"Fufu... You sure seem unusually quiet all of a sudden.//「ふふ。借りてきた猫ちゃんみたいですね。"借りてきた猫" means someone who is suddenly quiet.
I understand how you feel, but please make yourself comfortable. This is your home, after all, Shiki-sama."
"Y-Yeah, of course."
<Page4>
I hurriedly sit down on the sofa.
I just came back to my own house and I'm already overwhelmed by everything, it's really pathetic.//自分の家に帰ってきただけなのに、あらゆる事に圧倒されているとか、情けないにも程がある。

The girl in the kimono moves the tea wagon located in the corner of the living room closer, brews a cup of tea, and brings it to me on a tray.
<Page6>
"It's nothing special, but here you go."//「どうぞ、粗茶ですが」 "粗茶" is low-grade tea.
"Ah, thank you."
<Page7>
I can't help but feel embarrassed as she serves me politely with a smile on her face.
It's not because of my life at the Arima house and such. I'm just lower middle class at heart.//　有間の家での生活云々ではなく、きっと根が小市民なのだ、俺は。liberally localized last clause: lit. "surely, the root is that I'm lower middle class."
<Page8>
"I will go talk to Akiha-sama, please wait until then.# It will probably take about ten minutes, so you may want to look around the mansion until then."
"Is it fine for me to selfishly walk around on my own?"
<Page9>
"What are you talking about? This is your home now, how could it be selfish?//「何を仰いますやら！　ここは志貴さまのお家です、勝手も何もございません！
...#Ah, but you cannot go upstairs, Akiha-sama will be there."
<Page10>
"Please feel free to look around as much as you'd like so long as it is on the first floor.
It has been seven years since you have been to this mansion. I'm sure you are feeling nostalgic and excited."
<Page11>
She smiles mischievously.# 'If you may excuse me.'# The girl, who I think is a maid, bows and leaves the room.//　いたずらに微笑みながら、「それでは」とお辞儀をして、お手伝いさんと思われる少女は退室していった。 lit. closer to "While smiling mischievously, the girl who appears to be a maid leaves with a 'if you may excuse me.'"
<Page12>
She smiles mischievously.# 'If you may excuse me.'# Kohaku-san bows and leaves the room.

"......I give up."
The lavishly-made living room made my muttering reverberate even louder.
Should I stay here and pass the time being nervous,
or should I walk around the house?
I―――
C:> Will wait here quietly.
C:> Will go for a little walk.
