Suddenly, a question crosses my mind.
Why is she riding the train this early in the morning?
<Page2>
"But why?//from this point the file is similar to 01_01_CIEL01_1_3 refer to that while editing
Senpai, you're not a member of any clubs. Why are you heading to school this early?"
<Page3>
"Well, to tell you the truth, I'm on my way back from volunteering.//「いえ、何を隠そうボランティア活動の帰りなんです。
You see, the student council asked for volunteers to pick up trash in the park, right?
That's what I was doing until just now."
<Page4>
As she says that, I let out an 'Ah' as everything slides into place.
Senpai is the kind of person who's always working hard for someone else.
<Page5>
It was just a thirty-minute early morning volunteer activity.
Everyone else went back home for a while, but I thought I'd just go straight to school because heading home first would've been too much trouble."
Senpai's bag makes a clanking sound.
I thought it contained a tool for club activities, but it seems to be cleaning equipment.
<Page6>
"Oh, do you want to see what's inside? You're so bold to check out your Senpai's belongings, even though you seem so innocent."
<Page7>
Senpai leans in closer as if staring into my face.
...Well, her face, her smell, and so many other things are so close that I'm not even sure where to look.
<Page8>
"No, no, it's not that, I just thought that if you have a foldable broom or a rake, that would be unusual..."
<Page9>
"Hoh hoh, I see you also want to see my all-purpose long-range pruning shears.//「ほうほう。わたしの万能<高枝|たかえだ>切り<鋏|ばさみ>も見たいと。
All right. In that case, come by the tea ceremony club after school. You're more than welcome."
<Page10>
I feel embarrassed when she says such things with a soothing smile.
Unable to give a witty reply, all I can muster is a weak 'yes'.
<Page11>
"It's a promise then. Between you and me, we have a surplus of snacks purchased with club funds. It's not something that stays fresh long, so I need a healthy boy to help out."
"I-Is that so? Well, if my schedule permits, I'll certainly take you up on that offer.
Although, getting taken in by food is something a cat would do."
<Page12>
Her smile is so friendly that I can't help but joke a little.
<Page13>
The Senpai with a green ribbon replies,
"It's more like a dog, I think.
I mean, felines are no good. The ones you can rely on to the end are the disciplined and intelligent canines!"
She looks pleased with herself and shows a determination that I can't quite understand.
<Page14>
Because our destination is the same, the conversation somehow continues.
We talk about last week's mid-term exams.
About the gymnastics festival, which was reduced in scale and only lasted one day.
About the cafeteria, where the menu has never changed.
About the controversy between the students and the school over the use of mobile devices, which makes us both sigh, so we change the topic and laugh about our impressions of a movie we had recently seen.
<Page15>
Fifteen minutes pass quickly.
Senpai is a good conversationalist, and rumors have it that she is 'well-liked by both men and women'.
<Page16>
I find it regrettable that we'll get to Souya station in a few minutes, so I raise another topic.
―――But.
<Page17>
"...Hey, you're making too much noise."
Just like that, we were unaware of our surroundings.
We both bow our heads to apologize.
"......"
<Page18>
"...We've made her angry."
"...Sorry.
I was laughing too loud, I guess."
<Page19>
After that, the conversation ends.
It's as though the friendly atmosphere we had experienced up until now had been a lie.
Everyone is just a stranger, and a silence peculiar to the city dominates the train.
<Page20>
The train arrives at Souya Station.
It's just before seven o'clock.
It's a little early for school, and the city is still asleep.
The station is quiet now, but in an hour, it will be full of people and cars.
<Page21>
"There's not much traffic this morning either. It seems like the city is waking up late these days. I wonder if everyone is staying up late."
Senpai says something strange while carrying her heavy luggage.
<Page22>
"Um... would you like me to take your luggage to school?"
"Eh? Ah, no, no, don't worry about it. I have a stop to make, so I'll leave you here."
<Page23>
And so, waving her hand with a smile, Senpai runs off.
It is such a light and fast run that an onomatopoeic sound like 'boing' would be appropriate.
I instinctively want to break into a run as well so as not to be outdone, but I have no particular reason to hurry.
I'm going to head to school at my usual pace because I have to take care of my body.
<Page24>
...And then.
The girl from earlier comes out of the ticket gate.
<Page25>
She walks past me at a fast pace,
"You're as shallow as you look, aren't you? Disgusting."
and leaves behind a strong comment.
<Page26>
"――――――"
I'm stunned by her sudden rebuke.
Apparently, I offended her.
<Page27>
From now on, I'll be more careful when talking on the train.
I may have unintentionally uttered a word that made people uncomfortable.
<Page28>
Well, even if you take that into account,
"...Man, middle school students these days sure are intimidating."
Giving such harsh critique while just passing by, it's like a samurai casually executing a peasant.
