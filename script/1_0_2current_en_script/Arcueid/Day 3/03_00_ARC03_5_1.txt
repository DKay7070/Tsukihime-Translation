<Page1>
...This is a bad dream.
But then why is the smell of blood so horribly real?
<Page2>
"...It's no...t true"
Not true  Not true  Not true  Not true.
Not true  Not true  Not true  Not true.
What's not true? That I killed her?//　自分が殺したというコトが違うのか。
Or that I didn't kill her?//　それとも、自分が殺していないという事が違うのか。
<Page3>
"...But I had no reason to."//『……だって、理由が、ない』 tense-promotion because he already killed her.
No, I know exactly why.
When I looked at her, I could only think of one thing.
<Page4>
"I――――"
Yes, I―――
    Tohno Shiki wanted to kill that woman.//indented in japanese
<Page5>
That was all I could think about at the time.
I just didn't try to put that image into words because the inside of my head was mush.
<Page6>
"A mis――――take."
The smell of blood is making me nauseous.
"Ah―――ugh"
Something in my stomach is coming back up.
<Page7>
"Ah―――ah"
The vermilion seeps into my eyeballs.//　眼球に朱色が染み入ってくる。
I feel dizzy like my brain is shaking.//　脳を揺らすような眩暈。
Just like that, I fall to my knees in a sea of red blood.
<Page8>
"Hurk――ughh――"
Gastric juices well up in my throat.
I throw up everything in my stomach.
I throw up all the food and gastric juice while crying.
<Page9>
There is nothing left in my stomach.
And yet, my body forces me to vomit. It's as if it wants to pretend that what happened never did and return to my normal daily life.
<Page10>
"Hurg――――ahh"
It hurts.
It hurts like my insides are burning.
I can't stop crying and my body crumples to the ground like a piece of discarded garbage.
<Page11>
My body is now stained in thick red.//　べちゃりと、体が赤く染まる。
It is painful and red, like watching a dream.
<Page12>
The tears aren't stopping.//　涙が止まらない。
I killed that woman... It's awfully sad.//　人を殺したというコトが、ひどく悲しかった。
...No, that's not it.
As easily as dismembering a doll. Without meaning and without mercy, I killed her. I'm filled with sorrow.//　人形をバラすようにあっさりと、何の意味もなく、容赦なく殺してしまったコトが、悲しかった。
<Page13>
―――I just don't understand.
I don't know why I'm feeling this way,
I don't know why I killed her for no reason,
I don't understand why.
<Page14>
"――――It's a lie."
Because it doesn't feel real.
I mean, I feel dizzy like I always do.
It's just a dream that I saw while I was―――
<Page15>
"――――It's a lie."
I mean, how can it be possible to tear a person apart like that with a single knife?//　だいたい、どうしてナイフ一本で人間をあそこまでバラバラにできるっていうんだ。
I've heard that it takes an entire day of hard work to dismember a single human being, even with a saw.
<Page16>
So there's no way it can be done with just a knife like this.
In the first place, there's no such thing as a 'line'; they're just a delusion that I came up with all on my own.//　あの『線』なんて初めからなくって、自分が勝手に思いこんでいるだけの妄想で――――
<Page17>
"――――It's a lie."
The gastric juice keeps dripping from my lips.
Not only my mouth, but my body from the chin down is sticky with stomach fluids.//　口はおろか、あごから下は胃液でベトベトだ。
The gastric juices blend with the crimson.//　胃液には朱色が混ざっている。
There is nothing to vomit, but my stomach contracts. My esophagus and throat are bleeding.
<Page18>
"It... hurts―――"
It hurts.
That's why I'm sure.
This isn't a dream; I'm just lying to myself.
<Page19>
"―――Everything... is all a lie."
Yes, I really do understand.
I was lusting after her. I was excited to see this woman.
<Page20>
It's the same with my eyes.
If I already understood that these 'lines' would let me cut through things like paper,//　あの『線』が紙を切るようにモノを切断してしまうと分かっていたのなら。
then Tohno Shiki should have known that humans can be torn apart just as easily.//　遠野志貴は、人間だって簡単にバラしてしまうと理解していた筈なのに。
I... without even thinking about it, I had just been living irresponsibly.//　俺は、そんな事を考えもしないで、ただ無責任に暮らしてしまった。
<Page21>
...If I'm a dangerous person who can easily kill something,//　……自分が、簡単に何かを殺してしまう危険な人間なら。
I should have blinded myself or lived a life where I would never see another soul.
<Page22>
"...I'm sorry, Sensei."
―――I'm so sorry.
I couldn't even keep such a simple promise――――//　そんな簡単な事さえ、遠野志貴は守れなかった―――― japanese is much more ambiguous about what he's protecting. Should we change this?
<Page23>
"Am I―――still sane?"
I don't know. Not even a single atom of the impulses from earlier remain.//　わからない。さっきまで湧きあがっていた衝動は、もう微塵も残っていない。
<Page24>
But at that time, I didn't even think about enduring or suppressing those thoughts.
"Kill that woman."
I was thinking and doing things like that as a matter of course.
<Page25>
...Then the answer is simple.
I've definitely gone crazy.//　俺は、きっと狂っている。
It probably started seven years ago.
From that accident which should have killed me.
From that moment I miraculously survived―――――――
