Sensei once told me.
What my eyes see are the lines along which things can easily come apart.
In anatomical terms, they're like joints that can easily break,
or soft eyeballs.
<Page2>
If I put my blade in and slice through them, no force is required.
Without friction or resistance, anything can be cut.
This doesn't just apply to the human body, but to minerals or anything else for that matter.
These 'lines' appear equally on everything I can see.
<Page3>
"Listen carefully, Shiki.
All things are destined to break. As long as it has a form, it can't escape that fate, right?"
<Page4>
Therefore, the world itself is also full of cracks, and if it fell apart one day, it wouldn't be unusual.//それはつまり、セカイはツギハギだらけで、いつ壊れてもおかしくないという事だ。
That is, if the Earth's surface has lines running across it as well.
Some day, there's a chance that for no real reason at all, the ground could split apart, and everything on it would be destroyed.
At least, in the world I see, there's always that possibility.
<Page5>
"And we humans are even more fragile.
Injury and recovery, growing up and getting old, prosperity and decay; these are all processes that bring us closer to the end."// 　怪我も回復も、老化も成長も、隆盛も衰弱も、すべては終わりに近づく変化だから」 老化 is like "aging" but in what I would describe is an unpleasant way. 成長 is an antonym
<Page6>
When I understood the meaning of what she said, I thanked Sensei for these glasses from the bottom of my heart.
I mean, it is true, isn't it? If I had to see these lines all the time, I just wouldn't be able to get by.//だってそうだろう。こんな線がいつも視えてしまっていたら、とてもじゃないけど生きていけない。"とてもじゃない" is getting encoded as the "just" there as-in "well, there's no other option"
<Page7>
The lines along which things can easily break.//モノの壊れやすい線。
A world where nothing is firmly bound.//　確かな<約束|けつごう>のない世界。"約束" is dropped for a cleaner line.
Even if you could see them,
It wouldn't do you any good―――//得になる事なんて、何ひとつないのだから――――― "何ひとつないのだから" dropped because I don't know how to word it without ugly repetition.
<Page8>
"―――Hmnnn."
I awake from my old memories.//　古い記憶から目を覚ます。
I sense the morning light through my eyelids and feel around beside my pillow with my eyes closed.
<Page9>
...Huh... where are my glasses...?
Feeling uneasy, I grope around the right-hand side of my pillow, just in case, and immediately find them.
<Page10>
I usually keep them on the left-hand side... but with my bad headache last night, it's not out of the question that I made that mistake.//　左側に置いておくのが習慣なんだけど……昨夜は頭痛が酷くてそれどころではなかったのかもしれない。
<Page11>
"...Ah"
I put on my glasses before opening my eyelids.
If someone were watching, they may think it's a strange habit, but I like to avoid looking at the lines as much as possible.//　もし誰かが見ていたら妙なクセと思われるだろうけど、朝から『線』を視るような事態はできるかぎり遠慮したい。"朝から" dropped because it's "as much as possible" includes the whole day implicitly.
<Page12>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama."
"Eek?"
<Page13>
When I turn to face the wall where the voice came from, there's a girl in a maid's uniform standing there.
She didn't give any hint of her presence so I didn't notice her, but it appears she's been there for some time.
Just like yesterday, she must have come to wake me up so that I wouldn't oversleep.
<Page14>
"Ah. I'm sorry, it was weird for me to be so startled.
Good morning, Hisui. Thank you for coming to wake me up."
<Page15>
"This is one of my duties, please me no mind."//「それが私の役割ですから、どうか、お気になさらないようお願いします」
<Page16>
Hisui solemnly bows.
...But, as she does so, she suddenly stops moving and swiftly raises her head.//　……と。その途中でピタリと動きを止めた後、スッと頭を上げて、
<Page17>
"No, my duties do not involve surprising you.
―――I will make every effort not to startle you tomorrow."
<Page18>
...For a maid, she has a subtle strangeness about her.//　……微妙におかしなところのあるメイドさんだった。"おかしなところ" is more like "strange traits" but "subtly strange traits" is awkward imo.
Even though she is perfectly capable of performing her duties as a servant, it feels as though she is not accustomed to socializing.
<Page19>
"No, I don't think you did anything wrong.
It's my fault for still not being used to it."//まだ慣れていない俺が悪いんだ」
<Page20>
When I get out of bed, I realize that I'm wearing my pajamas.//　ベッドから起きると、自分が寝間着に着替えている事に気がついた。
...If I remember correctly, last night I changed into my school uniform because of the howling... and after I came back, I thought I collapsed straight into bed...?
<Page21>
"...That's weird. I thought I fell asleep in my uniform."
<Page22>
"That is correct. It would have been bad for your health if you stayed like that, so I asked Nee-san to come and change you into your pajamas."
<Page23>
Hisui explained the situation as if it were natural.
I see. She changed my clothes for me.
Sleeping in your uniform won't necessarily make you sick, but it will wrinkle and you'd be more comfortable in your pajamas. As expected of a professional maid, she's very thorough... wait a minute.
<Page24>
"Changed my clothes?"
I check my pants and underwear.
My pants are a new set of pajamas and even my underwear is brand new.
<Page25>
"Hisui."
"Yes, what is it?"
"I'm glad you're concerned about me, but from now on, please do whatever you can to wake me up... changing clothes is, you know, something I should be doing myself."
<Page26>
Embarrassed that it's too late, I can't help but avert my gaze. Hisui nods at me with a blank expression.
<Page27>
"Your school uniform is folded over there.
When you are dressed, please come to the living room."
<Page28>
"...Hah, normally I would've been woken up by that, but I must have been really tired last night..."
<Page29>
No amount of reflection is going to change the fact that I'm awake now.
I should quickly get dressed and have breakfast.
My school uniform is neatly folded and the shirt is crisply ironed.
When I put my arm through the sleeve, it feels as good as new.
<Page30>
Akiha and Kohaku-san are in the living room.
Akiha seems to have already finished her breakfast and is elegantly enjoying some tea.
I―――
C:> Greet Akiha.
C:> Greet Kohaku-san.
C:> Greet them both.
