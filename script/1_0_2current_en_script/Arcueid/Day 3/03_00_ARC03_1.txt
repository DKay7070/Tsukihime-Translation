Sensei once told me.
What my eyes see are the lines along which things can easily come apart.
In anatomical terms, they're like joints that can easily break,
or soft eyeballs.
<Page2>
If I put my blade in and slice through them, no force is required.
Without friction or resistance, anything can be cut.
This doesn't just apply to the human body, but to minerals or anything else for that matter.
These 'lines' appear equally on everything I can see.
<Page3>
"Listen carefully, Shiki.
All things are destined to break. As long as it has a form, it can't escape that fate, right?"
<Page4>
Therefore, the world itself is also full of cracks, and it could fall apart at any time.
That is, if the Earth's surface has lines running across it as well.
Some day, there's a chance that for no real reason at all, the ground could split apart, and everything on it would be destroyed.
At least, in the world I see, there is always that possibility.
<Page5>
"And we humans are even more fragile.
Injuries and recoveries, aging and growth, prosperity and decay; these are all processes that bring us closer to the end."
<Page6>
When I understood the meaning of what she said, I thanked Sensei for these glasses from the bottom of my heart.
I mean, it is true, isn't it? If I had to see these lines all the time, I wouldn't be able to live properly.
<Page7>
The lines along which things can be cut.
A world where nothing is firmly bound.
Even if you could see them,
there is nothing to be gained by seeing such things―――――
<Page8>
"――――――Hmnnn."
I wake up from my old memories.
I sense the morning light through my eyelids and feel around beside my pillow with my eyes closed.
<Page9>
...Huh... where are my glasses...?
Feeling uneasy, I grope around the right-hand side of my pillow, just in case, and immediately find them.
<Page10>
I usually keep them on the left side of my pillow... but maybe I had a bad headache last night and didn't have time for that.
<Page11>
"...Ah"
I put on my glasses before opening my eyelids.
If someone were watching, they may think it's a strange habit, but I like to avoid looking at the lines in the morning as much as possible.
<Page12>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama."
"Eek?"
<Page13>
When I turn to face the wall where the voice came from, there's a girl in a maid's uniform standing there.
She didn't give any hint of her presence so I didn't notice her, but it appears she's been there for some time.
Just like yesterday, she must have come to wake me up so that I wouldn't oversleep.
<Page14>
"Ah. I'm sorry, it was weird for me to be so startled.
Good morning, Hisui. Thank you for coming to wake me up."
<Page15>
"This is one of my duties, please do not mind me."
<Page16>
Hisui solemnly bows.
...But, as she does so, she suddenly stops moving and then swiftly raises her head.
<Page17>
"No, my duties do not involve surprising you.
―――I will make every effort not to startle you tomorrow."
<Page18>
...For a maid, she has some rather strange traits.
Even though she is perfectly capable of performing her duties as a servant, it feels as though she is not accustomed to socializing.
<Page19>
"No, I don't think you did anything wrong.
It's my fault, I'm still not used to it."
<Page20>
When I get out of bed, I realize that I have been dressed in my pajamas.
...If I remember correctly, last night I changed into my school uniform because of the howling... and after I came back, I thought I collapsed straight onto bed...?
<Page21>
"...That's weird. I thought I fell asleep in my uniform."
<Page22>
"That is correct. It would have been bad for your health if you stayed like that, so I asked Nee-san to come and change you into your pajamas."
<Page23>
Hisui explained the situation as if it were natural.
I see. She changed my clothes for me.
Sleeping in your uniform won't necessarily make you sick, but it will wrinkle and you'd be more comfortable in your pajamas. As expected of a professional maid, she's very thorough... wait a minute.
<Page24>
"Changed my clothes?"
I check my pants and underwear.
My pants are a new set of pajamas and even my underwear is brand new.
<Page25>
"Hisui."
"Yes, what is it?"
"I'm glad you're concerned about me, but from now on, please do whatever you can to wake me up... changing clothes, you know, is something I should be doing myself."
<Page26>
Embarrassed that it's too late, I can't help but avert my gaze. Hisui nods at me with a blank expression.
<Page27>
"Your school uniform is folded over there.
When you are dressed, please come to the living room."
<Page28>
"...Hah, normally I would've been woken up by that, but I must have been really tired last night..."
<Page29>
No amount of reflection is going to change the fact that I'm awake now.
I should quickly get dressed and have breakfast.
My school uniform is neatly folded and the shirt is crisply ironed.
When I put my arm through the sleeve, it feels as good as new.
<Page30>
Akiha and Kohaku-san are in the living room.
Akiha seems to have already finished her breakfast and is elegantly enjoying some tea.
I―――
C:> Greet Akiha.
C:> Greet Kohaku-san.
C:> Greet them both.
