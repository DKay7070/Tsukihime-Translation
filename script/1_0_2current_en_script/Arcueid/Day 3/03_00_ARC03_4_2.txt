After finishing my lunch in the cafeteria, I return to the classroom.
Since there's still some time before fifth period, the only people left in the classroom are a smattering of boys and close-knit groups of girls.

"......Huh?#"
I just realized.
I didn't see Yumizuka Satsuki among the girls.
She is the most... well, maybe the third most eye-catching girl in the class. When she's not here, it's enough to make me feel uncomfortable.

"...I wonder if she's out today."
To think I didn't notice until lunchtime, I must be pretty out of it.
The new homeroom teacher didn't say anything about it, so I guess she's just out sick today.
