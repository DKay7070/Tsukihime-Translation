...I can hear the sounds of rain coming from somewhere.
It's a prolonged, quiet drizzle.
<Page2>
"―――――"
I'm dizzy.
My throat hurts when I breathe.
"It... hurts."
A voice comes up.
"――――Shiki-sama?"
Just then, I hear someone's voice and presence nearby―――
<Page3>
"It's―――my room."
Before I know it, I'm lying down in my own room.
I put on my glasses from the bedside table.
<Page4>
"Good evening, Shiki-sama."
"Hisui...?"
"Yes. How are you feeling?"
"......"
<Page5>
Hisui asks me a strange question.
There's nothing particularly wrong with my body―――
<Page6>
"Wh―――y?"
Yes, why?
Why am I sleeping in a place like this―――?
<Page7>
"I―――that woman―――I ki―――"
I almost said 'I killed someone' but I shut my mouth.//　ころしたのに、と言いかけて口を塞ぐ。
That's the only thing that my reasoning stopped me from saying.//　その言葉だけは、口にしてはいけないと理性が歯止めをかけてくる。
<Page8>
"Hisui... why am I here?"
"...Do you not remember, Shiki-sama?"
Hisui slightly raises her eyebrows.//　翡翠はかすかに眉をひそめた。
<Page9>
"We received a call from the school saying that you had left early. However, when you did not return in the evening, my sister went to look for you. When she found you in the park, you appeared to be resting."//「学校の方から志貴さまは早退した、というお電話がありました。ですが夕方になっても帰ってこられず、姉が探しに行ったところ、公園でお休みになっていたそうです」 The last clause is somewhat liberally translated. Lit. "You appeared to have been resting in the park."
"The park―――You mean the park nearby?"//「公園って―――近くの公園？」
<Page10>
"Yes, you were resting on a bench. After my sister found you, you walked back to the residence on your own two feet."//「はい。志貴さまはベンチで休まれており、その後、ご自分の足で屋敷までお帰りになられました」
"...No way. I don't remember that at all."
<Page11>
"I do not think it's so strange that your memories aren't definite.//「志貴さまの記憶が定かではないのは、そうおかしな事ではないと思います。
Your consciousness could have been clouded by weakness as a result of your anemia."
<Page12>
"........."
...I really don't remember any of that.//　……まったく記憶がない。
But there is no room for doubt in what Hisui said.//　けど、翡翠の言葉には疑う余地がない。
<Page13>
"...Ah, it's already nine o'clock at night. ...I didn't notice it at all."
"Yes. When you got back here, you informed us only that you wanted to sleep and went off to rest in your room. I tried to call for a doctor, but you said, 'This happens all the time'."//「はい。お屋敷に戻られた志貴さまは、眠りたい、とだけ告げてお部屋で休まれたのです。お医者様をお呼びしようとしたのですが、志貴さまは『いつものことだから』、と」
<Page14>
"―――I see.
It's true that my anemia is always a problem, but―――"
<Page15>
...It was different this time.
I've killed someone―――no, wait.
<Page16>
"Hisui. What did I look like?"
"―――I'm sorry?"
"I mean my clothes. My shirt, my shoes, there should have been blood―――"
They were all wet and sticky.
<Page17>
"If you are talking about your uniform, it was dirty and I washed it."
"You're telling me you washed those bloody clothes...?!"
<Page18>
"...It is true that it was covered in mud, but there was nothing like a bloodstain. Besides, it was only your shirt and pants that were dirty. Your jacket was not particularly dirty."
<Page19>
"――――――"
...Unbelievable.
Even though I was kneeling in a sea of blood and my legs and arms were bright red...?//　血の海にひざまずいて、足も腕も真っ赤になっていたっていうのに……？
<Page20>
"Shiki-sama, did you have some sort of bad dream?//「志貴さま、なにかよくない夢でも見られていたのですか？
You seemed like you were having a terrible dream. Your face is still pale, even now."
Hisui is staring at me intently.
<Page21>
"That was―――a dream?"
Was it all a dream?
That feeling?
The smell of blood?
That ethereal woman in white?
"Yeah―――you're right. That must have all been a bad dream."
<Page22>
I let out a long sigh.
――――That's right.
It was all a bad dream.
It's not like I'd do something like that without meaning or reason and break a promise I made with Sensei when I was little.//　意味もなく理由もなく、幼い頃に先生と交わした約束を破って、俺があんなコトをするわけがなかったんだ。
<Page23>
"Aah――――I'm awake now."
"If you're feeling up to it, I can prepare dinner for you."
<Page24>
"Eh... no, dinner would be..."
...Even if that was a dream, I still can't get the color and smell of blood out of my mind.
<Page25>
"I'm sorry, I don't feel up to it.
I'm going to sleep like this tonight. More importantly, Hisui."
"Yes, what is it, Shiki-sama?"
"About that. You told me that I came back in the evening. Did Akiha say anything?"
<Page26>
"Akiha-sama was not present at that time. She came home about two hours ago and I informed her about your condition."
<Page27>
'What about it?' Hisui asks silently.
<Page28>
"It's nothing, really.
I've been here for three days, and I'm sure she's tired of the trouble I've caused her."
<Page29>
"...It is true that Akiha-sama's mood became worse, but I would not say that she is tired of you."
After saying that, Hisui takes a step back.
<Page30>
"Now, if you will excuse me.
If you need anything else, please let me know."
<Page31>
"Ah, thank you―――And I forgot to ask one more thing."
"Yes, what is it, Shiki-sama?"
"It's raining outside, isn't it? I was wondering when it started."
"It started before you arrived. When my sister found you, you were soaked."
<Page32>
"........"
I see. I don't even remember that happening.
It must have been the severe anemia... If that's the case, I should've just rested at school instead of pushing myself.
<Page33>
"Good night. I'm really sorry about today.
Please tell Kohaku-san I said thanks."
"Understood. ―――Please have a good night."
<Page34>
"―――Haah. So it was a dream."
...The words I muttered were utterly empty.
It doesn't feel real at all.
The realization that what I was thinking,
was actually a dream.
<Page35>
Outside, there is the sound of rain.
My head still feels a little heavy.
I look at my chest.
...The old scars from seven years ago are still clearly visible, like burn marks.
<Page36>
"...Ah."
On the desk in the room is a knife, a memento from my father.
"―――――"
...It was a dream.
It was nothing more than a dream.
I close my eyelids, repeating the same phrase, as if to deceive myself.
<Page37>
...I breathe in as if I'm trying to clear my lungs of that scent. A deep, deep breath.//　……肺に取りこんでしまった香気をかきだすように、長く長く息を吐く。
I give in to the dark sleep that severs my consciousness.
<Page38>
When I was a child.
I think someone told me not to tell lies that I couldn't even fool myself with.
