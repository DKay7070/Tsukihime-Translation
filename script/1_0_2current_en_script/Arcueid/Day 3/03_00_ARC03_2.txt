"Hey, Akiha.
About last night, is it like that here every night?"
"―――What?"
"Like I said, I'm talking about last night.
You and the others couldn't sleep either, right?"
"I slept fine last night... what are you talking about?"
"What am I talking about? Obviously I'm talking about that dog.
A wild dog was barking last night, from around eleven o'clock."
Akiha and Kohaku-san exchange glances and then stare at me with a concerned look in their eyes.
...I don't like the fact that they're thinking I'm a sleepwalker or something like that.
<Page2>
"Fine, I won't ask you.
Kohaku-san, it was loud last night, wasn't it?"
<Page3>
"―――Well... I'm not really sure.//「―――ええっと、どうなんでしょうか。
It's true that it was windy last night, but the only unusual thing we found during our midnight patrol was that you were asleep on top of your bed in your uniform."
"...Ah, you mean that? I'll be more careful from now on."
<Page4>
"What? What happened, Kohaku?"
"No, nothing happened, really.
It's just that Shiki-san was sleeping a little rough, that's all."
<Page5>
With a smile on her face, Kohaku-san dodges Akiha's question.
<Page6>
"...Are you sure neither of you noticed?
Last night, there was this wild dog barking outside for half an hour. Woof woof woof woof, it was so loud."
<Page7>
"Aha, you mean like the ones in Chubby Cherub, right?"
I couldn't quite tell by her reaction, whether she believes me or not.
<Page8>
"...Well, something like that, basically."
"Hmmm―――I don't remember any of that, though.
Neither do you, right, Kohaku?"
<Page9>
"I suppose not... I'm sorry, Shiki-san, but I don't think that happened."
<Page10>
"That settles it, then. The only other possible explanation is that Nii-san was dreaming of a dog barking at him."
"......Ugh."
<Page11>
If both of them say that, now I'm not so sure.
...When I think about it, it is strange that I heard that howl. There were no dogs outside, and the road―――
<Page12>
There was no one on the street.
The more they say it was a dream, the more I start to believe it as well.
<Page13>
"You are not used to the mansion yet, so that must be the reason why you had such a bad dream.
Well, if the wild dogs continue to bark tonight, perhaps we should get a ferocious guard dog of our own."
Akiha faintly displays a sadistic smile.
<Page14>
"It is time for me to go, so I will leave you to it. Nii-san, please be careful not to get attacked by dogs on your way to school."
<Page15>
Akiha gracefully leaves the living room.
To see her master off, Kohaku-san gives me a bow and then proceeds to leave the room as well.
