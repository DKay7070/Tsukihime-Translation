Fifth period.
The lesson on classical literature is making me sleepy, but I continue writing in my notebook.
Our high school has not yet approved the use of electronic devices for note-taking. The school said that they will eventually move to using tablets, but that seems to be a few years away.
<Page2>
However, the use of mobile devices in class is not discouraged. It's an unspoken agreement.
Even now, some students use their cell phones to read dictionaries, to exchange emails, or to browse websites.
I'm more of an analog person myself, so I write my class notes by hand like an old-fashioned student.

"――――"
It happened suddenly.
My consciousness intensified like it was accelerating.
A perspective that flips, twists, and flutters towards a point.
A sense of imbalance, as if my brain itself is spinning in circles.
<Page4>
My vision wavers.
I feel as though something is festering at the back of my head and that my consciousness is about to tumble out of my skull.
<Page5>
"...Not, good..."
I know this feeling.
This sudden dizziness is a precursor to anemia.
...How careless of me. I let my guard down, even knowing this could happen to my body at any time.
<Page6>
I hate this... I don't usually collapse in class but―――
<Page7>
In my darkening vision, I reach out and grab my desk to steady myself.
But it's all in vain.
I can't put any strength into my fingertips.
All that's left is for me to collapse to the floor―――
<Page8>
"Sensei, may I have a word?"
―――And then.
'Smack', someone hits me on the back roughly.
<Page9>
"Tohno's not feeling well, so I'd like to take him to the infirmary."
Before I know it, Arihiko has come up to me.
"Tohno, are you not feeling well?"
I hear the teacher's voice from the podium.
<Page10>
"No, I'm fine like th―――"
"Ah, no, he's not fine at all.
Shouldn't you send him home early?"
...Arihiko says something in a loud voice of his own accord.
<Page11>
"Is that so? The doctor has told me about Tohno's condition too. Tohno, if you're not feeling well, you can rest in the infirmary or leave early and go home."
...Maybe he's a good person after all.
The literature teacher seems to completely believe Arihiko's words.
<Page12>
"Come on, you can go home now. You look so pale. No one's going to know if you're feeling unwell until you tell someone, you know."
Arihiko pats me on the back reproachfully.
"...In that case, I'm going to leave early then, Sensei."
'Mmm' the literature teacher nods solemnly.
<Page13>
"...Sorry, Arihiko. For making you worry like this."
"Don't worry about it. We've been inseparable since middle school, so I can tell right away when you're about to keel over from anemia."
<Page14>
Arihiko goes back to his seat.
I manage to get up from my seat and leave the classroom with my body feeling like lead.
<Page15>
I leave the school building.
I thought about going to the infirmary to rest, but at this hour there is a high possibility that I would fall asleep until nighttime.
For that reason, I decided that it would be better to push myself a little and go back to the mansion.
<Page16>
"Phew... I think I'm feeling a little better."
As I breathe in the outside air, I begin to feel rejuvenated.
<Page17>
Seven years ago.
Perhaps this is the price of recovering from an accident that almost took my life, but since then, I have suffered from chronic anemia.
<Page18>
When I was first discharged from the hospital, I used to suffer from daily bouts of anemia.
Because of my condition, I missed many things, but thanks to the people around me, nothing serious ever happened.
<Page19>
Now that my body has grown, I don't experience dangerous symptoms provided I don't recklessly strain myself.
Even so, I can't stop myself from getting dizzy and losing consciousness occasionally.
Today I was lucky that Arihiko called out to me in the middle of it, but normally I would have fainted.//途中で声をかけてくれたから needs a recheck
<Page20>
"――――――"
I take a slow, deep breath, letting the fresh air fill my lungs.
While holding back that lingering feeling of something festering inside my head, I leave the school.
<Page21>
I walk out onto the street in front of the station.
...I can't believe it. This proves that I'm still in a daze.
I almost went into the ticket gate out of habit.
<Page22>
The place I'm going to is not the Arima house. It's the Tohno mansion. There's no need to take the train from here anymore.
<Page23>
"――――Ugh."
I'm still not feeling well.
I put my hand on my forehead and find that it's hotter than usual.
<Page24>
If I push myself too hard and collapse on the side of the road, I'll be even worse off than when I started.
"...I guess there's no choice, really."
I sit down on a bench, disgusted with myself.
I'm going to take a break until I feel better.
