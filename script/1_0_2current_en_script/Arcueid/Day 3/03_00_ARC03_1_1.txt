"Hey. Good morning, Akiha."
I decide to greet Akiha first.//　何はともあれ、まず秋葉に挨拶をする事にした。"何はともあれ" dropped. "At any rate" is a J-E antipattern and it doesn't really add anything imo
<Page2>
"...Good morning, Nii-san.
That was a rather lackluster greeting, did you not sleep well last night? You look like you are on the verge of collapse."
<Page3>
"Unfortunately, this is just my face. Don't expect me to greet you with such high spirits in the morning."
Regardless of what happened last night, I don't want my greetings to make people think that I'm some kind of delinquent, staying up late.
<Page4>
"Good morning, Shiki-san.
If you would like some breakfast, I can serve it in the dining room, so please feel free to ask me anytime."
On the other hand, Kohaku-san has this soothing effect. She and Akiha are like... the north wind and the sun maybe?//　一方、琥珀さんのこの癒し力。北風と太陽か。ellipses is a creative liberty but it reintroduces the pause from the jp.
<Page5>
"Thank you very much.
But have you finished already, Akiha? From the looks of it, you're having some post-breakfast tea."
<Page6>
"Of course. I don't particularly care what time you wake up, but at least make sure you have enough time for breakfast.//「当然です。兄さんがどんな時間に起床しようとかまいませんが、せめて朝食ぐらいは余裕をもって済ませてください。particularly added to give it a higher register
Having breakfast after seven o'clock is a sign you're getting soft."//　７時をすぎて朝食をとるなんて、たるんでいる証拠です」
<Page7>
I resist the urge to say, 'No, seven o'clock is normal'. It's this household that's abnormal.
<Page8>
"Hmm. What time do you get up, Akiha?"
"I wake up at five o'clock, what of it?"
"...I'm sorry, my mistake."
Despite saying something that would be unthinkable for a normal person, she is wearing a poisonous expression that says 'is that so strange?'. I can't help but be dumbfounded.//　常人では考えもしない事を、さも“不思議な事ですか？”なんて顔で返されては毒気も抜ける。"顔で返されては毒気も抜ける。" is quite loosely translated but I think it fits well in the sentence here.
I've never heard such a perfect response.
<Page9>
"What do you mean, your 'mistake'?"
"No... never mind that, what are you doing up so early? Trying not to be late?"
<Page10>
"Listen here. Unless something very serious happens, I will not be late. That will never happen.//「あのですね。よほどのトラブルがないかぎり、時間に遅れる、なんてコトはありません。
Your school is about a half-hour walk from here, correct? It is not that far, so do not be late. It would be embarrassing if you were."
<Page11>
Well, she's prickly as ever.
Given that everything she said was right, I can't think of any objections.
It's natural for Akiha to be concerned about the reputation of the Tohno family, no, as the head of the family, she has to be.
<Page12>
"Yeah, yeah. Even though my grades are fine, I'll be mindful of the time.//「はいはい。成績はともかく遅刻はしないよう心がけるよ。
And about staying up late―――"
As I said this, I remembered what happened last night.
I'm not the type to stay up late voluntarily, but if something keeps me up, it's no different.
